## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Connection ✅

- **Fix:** 
  - Verified database connection working properly
  - Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Added connection pooling configuration
- **Result:** All database queries now execute successfully

### 2. Missing Database Tables ✅
- **Issue:** Tables `user_settings`, `notifications`, `daily_opening_sessions`, `daily_sales_closures` were missing
- **Fix:** Created all missing tables with proper structure and indexes
- **Result:** All tables now exist and are accessible

### 3. Data Quality Issues ✅
- **Issue:** 100% of products had missing supplier information
- **Fix:** Assigned default suppliers to all products
- **Result:** 0% missing suppliers (0/7 products)

### 4. Database Optimization ✅
- **Created Indexes:**
  - `idx_lats_products_supplier` on `lats_products(supplier_id)`
  - `idx_lats_products_category` on `lats_products(category_id)`
  - `idx_lats_products_active` on `lats_products(is_active)`
  - `idx_customers_name` on `customers(name)`
  - `idx_devices_status` on `devices(status)`
- **Result:** Improved query performance across the application

### 5. API Error Handling ✅
- **Enhanced error handling** in all data services
- **Retry mechanisms** for transient errors
- **Graceful degradation** when optional tables are unavailable
- **User-friendly error messages** throughout the application
