# 🔍 Troubleshooting: Why Can't I See the Editing Features?

## Quick Checks

### 1. **Have you refreshed the page?**
The changes need to be loaded. Try:
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Clear cache and refresh
- Close and reopen the browser tab

### 2. **Are you on the right page?**
The editing features are on the **Purchase Order Detail** page, not the list page.

Navigate to:
```
Purchase Orders → Click on a specific order → Scroll to "Inventory Items" section
```

### 3. **Do you have received items?**
The editing only appears for items that have been received into inventory.

Check:
- Purchase order status should be "Received" or "Completed"
- There should be items in the "Inventory Items" table
- If table is empty, you need to receive items first

## Where to Look

### Location of Edit Features:

#### In the Inventory Items Table:

| Column | What You Should See |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Serial Number** | "Add Serial" button for items without serial |
| **IMEI** | "Add" button for items without IMEI |
| **Status** | Dropdown menu (Available/Sold/Reserved/Damaged) |
| **Location** | "Assign" button for items without location |
| **Cost Price** | Shows cost, and "Set Price" button below |

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Buttons are grayed out / disabled"
**Cause**: Items might be loading
**Fix**: Wait for loading to complete, then try again

### Issue 2: "Nothing happens when I click"
**Cause**: JavaScript error or event handler not connected
**Fix**: Check browser console for errors

### Issue 3: "I see the buttons but prompt doesn't show"
**Cause**: Pop-up blocker or browser security settings
**Fix**: Allow pop-ups for this site

### Issue 4: "Changes don't save"
**Cause**: Database permission error or network issue
**Fix**: Check console for error messages, verify database connection

### Issue 5: "Status dropdown doesn't show options"
**Cause**: CSS or rendering issue
**Fix**: Try refreshing page, check if dropdown is clickable

---

## Manual Verification

### Check if the code is loaded:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to the "Sources" or "Debugger" tab
3. Navigate to: `src/features/lats/pages/PurchaseOrderDetailPage.tsx`
4. Search for: `handleUpdateStatus`
5. If found, the code is loaded ✅

---

## Take Screenshots

If still not working, take screenshots of:

1. **The entire page** showing the inventory items table
2. **Browser console** showing any errors
3. **Network tab** (in Dev Tools) showing any failed requests
4. **The specific area** where you expect to see buttons

---

## Quick Test

Try this to confirm the feature is working:

1. Go to Purchase Order detail page
2. Find the "Status" column in the inventory items table
3. Look for a dropdown (should have colored background)
4. Click the dropdown
5. Do you see options? (Available, Sold, Reserved, Damaged)

If **YES** → Status editing works! Other features should also work
If **NO** → Something is wrong, check console for errors

---

## Alternative: Inspect Element

1. Right-click on where button should be
2. Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
3. Look at the HTML code
4. Search for: `handleUpdateStatus` or `Add Serial`
5. If found, the buttons exist in the DOM

## Expected Behavior Summary

When everything works correctly:

✅ Status column shows colored dropdowns  
✅ Clicking dropdown shows 4 options  
✅ Buttons say "Add Serial", "Add", "Assign", "Set Price"  
✅ Clicking buttons shows prompts  
✅ Entering data and clicking OK saves to database  
✅ Success toast appears after save  
✅ Table refreshes showing updated data  
✅ Hovering over existing data shows edit icon (✎)  

If any of these don't work, there's an issue to debug.
