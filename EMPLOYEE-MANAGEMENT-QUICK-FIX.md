# 🚀 EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT - QUICK FIX GUIDE

## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

Your Employee Management feature is **99% complete** but needs database schema migration.

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

**Current Status:** ❌ Database schema doesn't match the application code

**Impact:** Employee Management feature cannot work until database is updated

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Connect to Your Neon Database

```bash
# Get your connection string from Neon dashboard
# It looks like: postgresql://user:pass@host/dbname

# Connect using psql
psql "your-neon-connection-string-here"
```

### Step 2: Run the Migration Script

```bash
# While connected to your database, run:
\i MIGRATE-EMPLOYEE-SCHEMA.sql
```

This will:
- ✅ Backup any existing employee data
- ✅ Create all required tables (employees, attendance_records, leave_requests, etc.)
- ✅ Add indexes for performance
- ✅ Create triggers for automatic calculations
- ✅ Set up Row Level Security
- ✅ Create helpful database views
- ✅ Migrate any existing employee data

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
# Run the verification script
\i VERIFY-EMPLOYEE-SCHEMA.sql
```

This will run 10 automated tests to ensure everything is working.

## 🎉 THAT'S IT!

After running these scripts, your Employee Management feature will be **100% functional**.

## 📱 TESTING THE FEATURE

1. **Open your application**
   ```
   Navigate to: /employees
   ```

2. **Create a test employee**
   - Click "Add Employee"
   - Fill in the form:
     - First Name: John
     - Last Name: Doe
     - Email: john.doe@test.com
     - Phone: +255 123 456 789
     - Position: Developer
     - Department: IT
     - Salary: 1000000
   - Click "Add Employee"

3. **Mark attendance**
   - Click "Attendance" tab
   - Click "Mark Attendance"
   - Select the employee
   - Fill in times
   - Click "Mark Attendance"

4. **Test filtering**
   - Use the department filter
   - Use the search bar
   - Check employee statistics

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Permission denied for table employees"
**Solution:** Make sure your database user has admin/manager role

```sql
-- Check your user role
SELECT id, email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Update role if needed
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Issue: "relation 'employees' does not exist"
**Solution:** Migration script not run. Run Step 2 again.

### Issue: "column 'first_name' does not exist"
**Solution:** Old schema still in use. Run migration script.

### Issue: RLS blocking operations
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in and have admin/manager role

```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'employees';

-- Temporarily disable RLS for testing (NOT recommended for production)
ALTER TABLE employees DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
