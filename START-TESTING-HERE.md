# 🚀 START TESTING HERE - Branch/Store Integration

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

I've successfully implemented **branch/store integration** for your Employee Management system. Everything is ready for testing!

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### ✨ **Employee Management - 100% COMPLETE**

1. **✅ Branch Selector Component**
   - Reusable dropdown for selecting branches
   - Shows active branches with icons
   - Marks main branch with 🏢 emoji

2. **✅ Employee Form Integration**
   - Branch selector added to Create/Edit Employee forms
   - Branch assignment is REQUIRED (validated)
   - Replaces the old text "Location" field

3. **✅ Employee Table Enhancement**
   - New "Branch/Store" column added
   - Shows branch name with 📍 icon
   - Displays "Unassigned" for employees without branch

4. **✅ Branch Filtering**
   - "Filter by Branch" dropdown added
   - Filter employees by specific branch
   - Works with other filters (department, status)

5. **✅ API Functions**
   - `getEmployeesByBranch(branchId)`
   - `assignEmployeeToBranch(employeeId, branchId)`
   - `removeEmployeeFromBranch(employeeId)`
