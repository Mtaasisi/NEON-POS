## ⚠️ Common Questions

**Q: Will this delete any data?**  
A: No! It only ADDS missing data and FIXES existing data. Nothing is deleted.

**Q: Why do products show $0.00 after fix?**  
A: The fix sets NULL prices to 0 to prevent errors. You update with real prices afterward.

**Q: Will this break anything?**  
A: No! The script runs in a transaction and can be rolled back if needed.

**Q: Can I run this multiple times?**  
A: Yes! It's safe to run multiple times. Uses INSERT...ON CONFLICT for safety.

**Q: What if I need to undo?**  
A: The script runs in a BEGIN/COMMIT transaction. If it fails, nothing changes.
