### Option 2: Diagnostic First (If you want details) 🔍

**Step 1:** Run diagnostic
```
🔍-DIAGNOSE-BRANCH-TRANSFERS.sql

## 📊 What Gets Fixed

The script adds these missing columns to your database:

**branch_transfers table:**
- ✅ `rejection_reason` - Why transfers were rejected
- ✅ `metadata` - Additional transfer data
- ✅ `requested_at`, `approved_at`, `completed_at` - Timestamps
- ✅ `created_at`, `updated_at` - Tracking columns

**lats_product_variants table:**
- ✅ `reserved_quantity` - For stock reservations

**Database functions:**
- ✅ 7 functions for stock management
- ✅ Triggers for auto-updates

---

## 🔍 Why This Happened

Your `branch_transfers` table was created with the basic structure, but is missing columns that the application code expects. This is common if you:
- Ran `SETUP-STOCK-TRANSFER-TABLE.sql` but not the complete fix
- Updated the code but not the database
- Started with an older database schema

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- ✅ **Safe to run** - Won't delete or modify existing data
- ✅ **Can run multiple times** - Script checks before adding columns
- ✅ **No downtime** - App keeps running
- ⏱️ **Takes ~10 seconds** to complete

---

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

1. **Check SQL output** - Look for error messages in red
2. **Verify columns exist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name 
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'branch_transfers'
   ORDER BY column_name;
   ```
3. **Clear browser cache completely**
4. **Check browser console** for new error messages

## 📞 Success Checklist

After running the fix, you should see:
- ✅ "STOCK TRANSFER FIX COMPLETE!" message
- ✅ No errors in SQL editor
- ✅ Can create transfers without errors
- ✅ Transfers show correct status
