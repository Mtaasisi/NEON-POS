**FULL DEBUG LOGGING** to track exactly what's happening:

### 🛍️ **Product Queries:**

### **Step 3: Clear Everything**

In the console, run:

## ✅ Expected Results:

| Branch | Products | Sales | Console Shows |
|--------|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Main Store** | 69 | 20 | 🔒 BRANCH FILTERING ACTIVE → 69 products, 20 sales |
| **ARUSHA** | 0 | 0 | 🔒 BRANCH FILTERING ACTIVE → 0 products, 0 sales |
| **Airport** | 0 | 0 | 🔒 BRANCH FILTERING ACTIVE → 0 products, 0 sales |

## 🐛 If You See Problems:

### **Problem A: "NO BRANCH FILTER - SHOWING ALL"**
**Means:** No branch_id in localStorage
**Fix:** Switch branches using the selector

### **Problem B: "Products returned: 69 in ARUSHA"**
**Means:** Products have `sharing_mode = 'shared'` or query not filtering
**Check:** Console should show exactly which filter is applied

### **Problem C: "Query failed" errors**
**Means:** Missing columns in database
**Fix:** Run the SQL migration again
