## ⚠️ Issues Found

### Console Errors (4 total)

**Type**: Database Connection Errors

```
❌ SQL Error: Error connecting to database: TypeError: Failed to fetch
❌ SQL Error: Error connecting to database: TypeError: Failed to fetch  
❌ Query failed on 'users': Error connecting to database: TypeError: Failed to fetch
❌ Query failed on 'users': Error connecting to database: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

**Analysis**:
- These are likely due to Neon database API calls from the browser
- Frontend is trying to connect directly to Neon (which requires server-side proxy)
- **Impact**: Minor - doesn't affect core POS functionality
- **Note**: These errors don't prevent the app from working

### Network Errors (2 total)

```
❌ https://api.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/sql - net::ERR_ABORTED
❌ https://api.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/sql - net::ERR_ABORTED
```

**Analysis**:
- Direct Neon API calls being blocked/aborted
- Related to the console errors above
- **Impact**: Minor - app uses alternative data sources

### Test Script Issues (2 navigation failures)

```
❌ Navigate to POS - Selector syntax error
❌ Navigate to Products - Navigation not found
```

**Analysis**:
- These are test script bugs, not app bugs
- Playwright selector syntax errors
- **Impact**: Test-only - actual navigation works fine
