# Purchase Order Price Tracking - Fixed! ✅

## 🐛 Problem Found

When creating purchase orders, the system was NOT storing:
- ❌ **Cost Price** (unit_cost) - Fixed earlier
- ❌ **Selling Price** - Was completely missing!

This meant you couldn't track what prices you agreed to at the time of ordering.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Frontend - POcreate.tsx**
- Added `sellingPrice` field to `PurchaseCartItemType` interface
- When adding product to cart, now captures the variant's selling price
- When creating PO, passes `sellingPrice` along with `costPrice`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Cart Item Interface - Added sellingPrice field
interface PurchaseCartItemType {
  ...
  costPrice: number;
  sellingPrice?: number; // NEW: Store selling price for PO tracking
  ...
}

// When adding to cart - Capture selling price
const newItem: PurchaseCartItem = {
  ...
  costPrice: costPrice,
  sellingPrice: selectedVariant.sellingPrice || selectedVariant.price || 0, // NEW
  ...
};

// When creating PO - Include selling price
items: purchaseCartItems.map(item => ({
  ...
  costPrice: item.costPrice,
  sellingPrice: item.sellingPrice || 0, // NEW
  ...
}))
```

### 2. **Backend - provider.supabase.ts**
- Updated `createPurchaseOrder` to store `selling_price` in PO items table

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Purchase Order Items - Store selling price snapshot
const items = data.items.map((item: any) => ({
  ...
  unit_cost: item.costPrice,
  selling_price: item.sellingPrice || 0, // NEW: Store selling price at time of PO
  subtotal: item.quantity * item.costPrice
}));
```

## 📊 What This Means

### Before the Fix:
```
Purchase Order Created:
  Product: iPhone 15
  Quantity: 10
  Cost Price: ❌ Not stored
  Selling Price: ❌ Not stored
  
You have NO RECORD of agreed prices! 😱
```

### After the Fix:
```
Purchase Order Created:
  Product: iPhone 15  
  Quantity: 10
  Cost Price: ✅ 900 (stored)
  Selling Price: ✅ 40,000 (stored)
  
Perfect! You have a complete price snapshot! 🎉
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Price History** - Know exactly what you agreed to pay when you ordered
2. **Profit Tracking** - Calculate expected profit margins at order time
3. **Price Change Detection** - Compare PO prices vs current prices
4. **Audit Trail** - Complete record for accounting and reporting
5. **Better Analytics** - Accurate cost and profit analysis

## 📝 Database Fields

**`lats_purchase_order_items` table now stores:**
- `unit_cost` - Cost price agreed with supplier (what you pay)
- `selling_price` - Your selling price at time of order (what you'll charge)
- `subtotal` - Total cost (quantity × unit_cost)

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Test It!** - Create a new PO and verify prices are saved:
   - Add products to PO
   - Check database after creating PO
   - Verify both cost_price and selling_price are stored

2. **Historical Data** - Old POs won't have selling_price saved (will show as NULL or 0)

3. **Future Enhancement Ideas:**
   - Show profit margin when creating PO
   - Alert if current prices differ from PO prices
   - Report on price changes over time

## 📋 Files Modified
