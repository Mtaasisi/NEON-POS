## ℹ️ About the Console Error

The error you see (`fixOrderStatusIfNeeded`) is **NOT** related to payment processing. It's a separate function that tries to auto-update order status.

### What's Happening:
```
Payment Processing ✅ WORKING
       ↓
Payment Completed ✅ SUCCESS
       ↓
Auto-Status Update ⚠️ NON-CRITICAL ERROR (cosmetic issue)
```

### Why It's Not a Problem:
- ✅ Payment was successful
- ✅ Money was deducted
- ✅ Expense was tracked
- ⚠️ Status update just failed (doesn't affect payment)

The error is just about automatically updating the PO status from "sent" to "received". I've enhanced the error logging to show more details next time, but it doesn't affect your payments at all.
