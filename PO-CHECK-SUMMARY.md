## üîÑ Status Flow Analysis

### Workflow Progression

```
Draft ‚Üí Pending Approval ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí Sent ‚Üí Confirmed ‚Üí Shipped ‚Üí Received ‚Üí Completed
```

**Key Checkpoints:**
1. ‚úÖ **Approval Gate** - Prevents unapproved orders from being sent
2. ‚úÖ **Payment Gate** - Prevents receiving without payment
3. ‚úÖ **Permission Gate** - Restricts sensitive actions by role

### Status Transition Validation

| From Status | To Status | Validation | Status |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| draft | pending_approval | Permission check | ‚úÖ |
| pending_approval | approved | Manager/Admin only | ‚úÖ |
| pending_approval | draft | Rejection flow | ‚úÖ |
| approved | sent | Standard transition | ‚úÖ |
| sent | confirmed | Standard transition | ‚úÖ |
| confirmed | shipped | Standard transition | ‚úÖ |
| shipped | received | **Payment required** | ‚úÖ |

## üí≥ Payment Protection Analysis

### Payment Status Checks

```typescript
// Example payment gate implementation
if (purchaseOrder.paymentStatus === 'paid') {
  // ‚úÖ Show receive buttons
} else {
  // ‚ùå Block receive, show payment button
}
```

**Payment Gate Locations:**
1. ‚úÖ PurchaseOrdersPage - `getSmartActionButtons()`
2. ‚úÖ PurchaseOrderDetailPage - Status-specific action rendering
3. ‚úÖ ReceiveModal - Pre-receive validation

**Payment Protection Features:**
- ‚úÖ Cannot receive unpaid orders

    return true; // Full access
  }
  
  if (currentUser.role === 'staff') {
    return action === 'edit' || action === 'create'; // Limited access
  }
  
  return false; // No access
}
```
