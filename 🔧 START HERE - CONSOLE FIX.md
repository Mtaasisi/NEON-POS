## ❓ Need Help?

**Q: Browser refresh didn't help?**  
A: Make sure it's a HARD refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R), not regular refresh

**Q: Still seeing the SMS error?**  
A: That's normal! SMS is optional. Only run the SQL if you need SMS features.

**Q: Still seeing other errors?**  
A: Check if they're NEW errors (different from before) and let me know
