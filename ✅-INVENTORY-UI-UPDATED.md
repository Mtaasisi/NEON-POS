# ✅ Inventory UI Updated - Shows Reserved Stock

## 🎉 What Was Done

Updated the inventory UI to properly display stock reservations from approved/pending stock transfers.

---

## 📊 Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Inventory Display (EnhancedInventoryTab.tsx)

**Before:**
```
Stock Column:
  100 units
```

**After:**
```
Stock Column:
  90 available ← Main number (what can be sold/transferred)
  (10 reserved) ← Reserved for pending transfers (orange text)
  Total: 100 units ← Complete inventory count (gray text)
  ⚠️ Reorder needed ← Warning if available stock is low
```

### 2. Updated Data Fetching

Added `reserved_quantity` to all variant queries:

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `src/lib/latsProductApi.ts` - Main product fetching (2 locations)
- ✅ `src/features/lats/lib/liveInventoryService.ts` - Live metrics
- ✅ `src/features/lats/lib/analyticsService.ts` - Analytics
- ✅ `src/features/lats/components/inventory/EnhancedInventoryTab.tsx` - UI display

### 3. Calculation Logic

```typescript
// For each product:
const totalStock = sum of all variant quantities
const reservedStock = sum of all variant reserved_quantities  
const availableStock = totalStock - reservedStock

// Stock status based on AVAILABLE stock (not total):
- Out of stock: availableStock ≤ 0
- Low stock: availableStock ≤ 10
- In stock: availableStock > 10
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Example Scenario

**Product: Widget Model X**

#### Before Transfer Created:
```
Total Stock: 100 units
Reserved: 0 units
Available: 100 units
Display: "100 available"
```

#### After Transfer Created (Pending/Approved):
```
Total Stock: 100 units
Reserved: 20 units (locked for transfer)
Available: 80 units
Display: 
  "80 available"
  "(20 reserved)"
  "Total: 100 units"
```

#### After Transfer Completed:
```
Source Branch:
  Total Stock: 80 units (reduced by 20)
  Reserved: 0 units (released)
  Available: 80 units
  Display: "80 available"

Destination Branch:
  Total Stock: 70 units (increased by 20)
  Reserved: 0 units
  Available: 70 units
  Display: "70 available"
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Accurate Availability** - Users see what's actually available for sale/transfer
2. **Visibility** - Reserved stock is clearly shown (no confusion)
3. **Better Planning** - Can see pending transfers affecting stock
4. **Prevents Overselling** - Stock status based on available (not total)

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: View Reserved Stock

1. Go to **Inventory** page
2. Look at products with pending/approved transfers
3. You should see:
   - Available stock (bold)
   - Reserved stock (orange, if > 0)
   - Total stock (gray)

### Test 2: Create Transfer and Watch Reservation

1. **Before Transfer:**
   - Product shows: "100 available"

2. **Create Transfer (20 units):**
   - Product updates to: 
     - "80 available"
     - "(20 reserved)"
     - "Total: 100 units"

3. **Complete Transfer:**
   - Source shows: "80 available" (reservation released)
   - Destination shows increased stock

4. **Cancel Transfer:**
   - Product shows: "100 available" (reservation released)

### Test 3: Stock Status Accuracy

1. Product with 100 total, 95 reserved:
   - Available: 5 units
   - Status: Should show "Low Stock" ✅
   - (Based on available, not total)

2. Product with 50 total, 50 reserved:
   - Available: 0 units
   - Status: Should show "Out of Stock" ❌
   - (All stock is reserved)

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Data Flow

```
1. Database (Neon)
   ↓
   latsProductApi.ts fetches variants with reserved_quantity
   ↓
2. Zustand Store (useInventoryStore)
   ↓
   Stores products with complete variant data
   ↓
3. Inventory UI (EnhancedInventoryTab)
   ↓
   Calculates: available = total - reserved
   ↓
4. Display
   Shows all three values clearly
```

### Key Formulas

```typescript
// Per product
totalStock = variants.reduce((sum, v) => sum + v.quantity, 0)
reservedStock = variants.reduce((sum, v) => sum + (v.reserved_quantity || 0), 0)
availableStock = totalStock - reservedStock

// Stock status
stockStatus = 
  availableStock <= 0 ? 'out-of-stock' :
  availableStock <= 10 ? 'low-stock' :
  'in-stock'
```

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Why does my stock show as "Out of Stock" when I have units?**
A: Those units are reserved for pending transfers. Check the "(X reserved)" text.

**Q: Where can I see what transfers are reserving stock?**
A: Go to Stock Transfers page and look for "Pending" or "Approved" transfers.

**Q: Will reserved stock be released if I cancel a transfer?**
A: Yes! Cancelling or rejecting a transfer immediately releases the reservation.

**Q: Can I sell reserved stock?**
A: No. Reserved stock is locked until the transfer completes or is cancelled.

**Bottom Line:** Your inventory now shows exactly what's available vs what's reserved for transfers! 🎯
