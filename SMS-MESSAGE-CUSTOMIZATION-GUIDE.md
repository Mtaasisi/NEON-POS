psql -h your-neon-host -U your-user -d your-database -f ADD-SMS-MESSAGE-FIELDS.sql
```

Or manually execute the SQL in your Neon SQL Editor:

3. Click on **Receipt Settings** tab

### Step 3: Customize Messages
Scroll down to the **SMS/Receipt Message** section where you'll see:

- **SMS Header Message**: The greeting that appears at the top
  - Default: "Thank you for your purchase!"
  - Examples:
    - "üéâ Thanks for shopping with us!"
    - "Asante sana kwa ununuzi wako!" (Swahili)
    - "We appreciate your business!"

  - Examples:
    - "Come back soon! üòä"

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Keep it Short**: SMS has character limits, keep messages concise
2. **Be Clear**: Use simple, friendly language
3. **Add Value**: Consider including useful info like support contact
4. **Test First**: Make a test sale to see how it looks
5. **Use Emojis Sparingly**: They work in SMS but don't overdo it
6. **Localize**: Use your customers' language for better engagement

## Troubleshooting

### Messages not updating?
1. Make sure you clicked **Save** in POS Settings
2. Clear your browser cache and refresh
3. Check that the database migration ran successfully

### Still seeing old messages?
The system will use default messages if settings can't be loaded. Check:
1. Database migration was successful
2. No errors in browser console
3. POS Settings are loading correctly
