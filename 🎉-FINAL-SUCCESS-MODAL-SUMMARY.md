## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Sound requires user interaction first** - First click might not play (browser security), but after that it works perfectly!

2. **Sound is pleasant and quick** - Won't annoy users or interrupt their work

3. **Works with existing sounds** - Doesn't conflict with click sounds, payment sounds, etc.

4. **Failsafe** - If sound can't play, modal still appears (no errors)
