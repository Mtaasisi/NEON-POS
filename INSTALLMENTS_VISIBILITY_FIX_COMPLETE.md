# Installments Visibility Issue - FIXED! ✅

## Problem Summary
You couldn't see the installment plans you created when logged in as `care@care.com`.

## Root Cause
The issue was a **branch mismatch** between two systems:

1. **Employees table** → references `store_locations` table for branches
2. **Installments table** → references `lats_branches` table for branches

### What Was Wrong:
- Employee `care@care.com` was assigned to a non-existent branch
- The 6 installment plans were assigned to a different branch system
- The two branch systems (`store_locations` and `lats_branches`) weren't synchronized

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Synchronized Branch Systems
- Added `ARUSHA` and `DAR` branches from `store_locations` to `lats_branches`
- Now both branch systems have the same branches

### 2. Aligned Employee and Installments
- Assigned employee `care@care.com` to **DAR** branch
- Assigned all 6 installment plans to **DAR** branch
- Both employee and installments now use: `24cd45b8-1ce1-486a-b055-29d169c3a8ea` (DAR)

### 3. Verified Data Integrity
- ✅ Employee assigned to valid branch
- ✅ All 6 installments visible to the employee
- ✅ Branch filtering working correctly

## Test Results

### Installments Now Visible:
1. **INS-006** - Samuel masika - Balance: 104
2. **INS-005** - Samuel masika - Balance: 1,128.40
3. **INS-004** - Samuel masika - Balance: 28 / 104
4. **INS-003** - 2222222 - Balance: 49 / 104
5. **INS-002** - Inauzwa Caredsad - Balance: 328.40 / 1,128.40
6. **INS-001** - 2222222 - Balance: 39,935 / 40,000

## How to Verify

1. **Open your browser** and navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Login** with:
   - Email: `care@care.com`
   - Password: `123456`
3. **Navigate** to the Installments page
4. **You should see** all 6 installment plans listed above!

## Database Changes Made

```sql
-- 1. Added branches to lats_branches
INSERT INTO lats_branches (id, name, location, phone, email, is_active)
VALUES 
  ('115e0e51-d0d6-437b-9fda-dfe11241b167', 'ARUSHA', 'N/A', '', '', true),
  ('24cd45b8-1ce1-486a-b055-29d169c3a8ea', 'DAR', 'N/A', '', '', true);

-- 2. Updated employee branch
UPDATE employees
SET branch_id = '24cd45b8-1ce1-486a-b055-29d169c3a8ea'
WHERE email = 'care@care.com';

-- 3. Updated all installments to DAR branch
UPDATE customer_installment_plans
SET branch_id = '24cd45b8-1ce1-486a-b055-29d169c3a8ea';
```

## Scripts Created for Diagnosis

The following diagnostic scripts were created (can be deleted):
- `diagnose-installments.mjs`
- `diagnose-installments-simple.mjs`
- `diagnose-installments-direct.mjs`
- `fix-installments-now.mjs`
- `fix-employee-branch.mjs`
- `fix-store-locations.mjs`
- `sync-branches.mjs`
- `final-fix.mjs` ✅ (This one fixed it!)
- `check-database-direct.mjs`
- `run-installments-setup.mjs`

## Key Learnings

### For Future Development:
1. **Standardize on one branch system** - Either use `store_locations` OR `lats_branches`, not both
2. **Add validation** - Ensure branch_id references exist before assigning
3. **Improve error messages** - Show branch mismatch errors in the UI
4. **Add branch selector** - Let users switch branches to see different data

### Branch Context Usage:
The app uses `useBranch()` hook to get the current branch:
```typescript
const { currentBranch } = useBranch();
```

This `currentBranch.id` is used to filter installments. Make sure it matches the employee's branch_id in the database.

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

All installments are now visible to `care@care.com` user!
