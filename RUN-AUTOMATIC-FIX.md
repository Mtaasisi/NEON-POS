## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Error: "No database connection string found"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Make sure DATABASE_URL is set
echo $DATABASE_URL

# If empty, set it:
export DATABASE_URL="your-connection-string"
```

### Error: "Authentication failed"

**Fix:**
- Verify username and password in connection string
- Check if database is running
- Test connection: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT 1"`

### Error: "Permission denied"

**Fix:**
- You need ALTER TABLE privileges
- Connect as database owner
- Or request ALTER privileges from admin

### Error: "pg module not found"

**Fix:**
```bash
npm install pg
```

### Still Not Working?

**Use manual method:**
1. Open Neon SQL Editor
2. Copy `fix-product-deletion.sql`
3. Paste and run
4. Done!

## 🔄 Running Multiple Times

**It's safe to run the fix multiple times!**

The script checks if constraints already exist and only updates what needs fixing.

```bash
# Run as many times as you want
npm run fix:product-deletion
npm run fix:product-deletion
npm run fix:product-deletion
# All safe! ✅
```

---

## 🧪 Diagnose Before Fixing

Want to see what's wrong first?

### Using NPM:
```bash
npm run diagnose:product-deletion
```

### Using SQL File:
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f diagnose-product-deletion.sql
```

This shows:
- Which constraints are blocking deletion
- How many products have dependencies
- Which products can be safely deleted

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Add to .bashrc or .zshrc

```bash
echo 'export DATABASE_URL="your-connection-string"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now `DATABASE_URL` is always available!

### Create an Alias

```bash
echo 'alias fix-products="npm run fix:product-deletion"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now just run:
```bash
fix-products
```

### Use .env File (Recommended)

Create `.env` in your project:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db
```

Add to `.gitignore`:
```
.env
```

Load and run:
```bash
source .env
npm run fix:product-deletion
```
