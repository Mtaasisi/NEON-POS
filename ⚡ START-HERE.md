### ✅ Step 2: Run the Automated Fix (2 minutes)

2. Open the file: **`FIX-NEW-PRODUCT-PRICE-ISSUE.sql`**
3. **Copy the entire file contents**
4. **Paste into SQL Editor**
5. Click **Run** button

**What will happen:**
```
🔧 STARTING AUTO-FIX...
✅ Created default variants for products without them
✅ Fixed zero-price variants
✅ Created auto-trigger for new products

```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Verify It Worked (1 minute)

**Test 1: Check existing products**
```sql
SELECT 
  p.name,
  COUNT(v.id) as variants,
  MAX(v.unit_price) as price
FROM lats_products p
LEFT JOIN lats_product_variants v ON p.id = v.product_id
WHERE p.is_active = true
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

All products should have `variants > 0` and `price > 0` ✅

**Test 2: Create a new product**
1. Go to your POS system
2. Create a new product:
   - Name: "Test Product 123"
   - Price: $50.00
   - Stock: 10
3. Save the product
4. Search for it in POS
5. **Should display: $50.00** ✅

## 🚨 If Something Went Wrong

### Error: "Column does not exist"
**Don't worry!** The script auto-detects column names. Make sure you:
1. Copied the **entire** SQL file (including BEGIN and COMMIT)
2. Ran it all at once (not line by line)

### Still showing $0 after fix
Run this diagnostic:
```sql
SELECT 
  p.name,
  p.unit_price as product_price,
  v.name as variant_name,
  v.unit_price as variant_price,
  v.selling_price
FROM lats_products p
JOIN lats_product_variants v ON p.id = v.product_id
WHERE p.name = 'YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME';
```

Check if `variant_price` or `selling_price` is still 0. If yes:
```sql
UPDATE lats_product_variants v
SET unit_price = p.unit_price, selling_price = p.unit_price
FROM lats_products p  
WHERE v.product_id = p.id AND p.name = 'YOUR_PRODUCT_NAME';
```
