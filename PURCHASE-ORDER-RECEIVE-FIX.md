# Purchase Order Receive Issue - Fix Guide

## 🚨 Problem Identified

When clicking "Receive Order" on a purchase order, the order status changes to "received" but **NO inventory items are created**. This causes:

- ✗ Received Items tab shows 0 items
- ✗ No inventory items in the database
- ✗ Stock levels don't update
- ✗ Products remain unavailable for sale

### Root Cause

The `completeReceive` function in `purchaseOrderService.ts` calls a database function `complete_purchase_order_receive` that **DOESN'T EXIST**.

```typescript
// This code calls a non-existent function:
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .rpc('complete_purchase_order_receive', {
    purchase_order_id_param: purchaseOrderId,
    user_id_param: userId,
    receive_notes: receiveNotes || null
  });
```

### Evidence from Console

```
✅ [PurchaseOrderService] Complete receive event emitted
📋 Switched to received tab to show received items
✅ [PurchaseOrderService] Received items fetched via RPC: {total: 0}
✅ [PurchaseOrderDetailPage] Received items loaded: 0 items  ❌ PROBLEM!
```

---

## ✅ Solution

Created the missing database function that:
1. ✓ Validates the purchase order exists and is in correct status
2. ✓ Creates inventory items for all ordered quantities
3. ✓ Updates purchase order item quantities
4. ✓ Changes order status to 'received'
5. ✓ Creates audit log entry
6. ✓ Returns detailed summary

## 🔧 How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Run the Migration Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x run-complete-receive-migration.js

# Run the migration
node run-complete-receive-migration.js
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `migrations/create_complete_purchase_order_receive_function.sql`
4. Paste and execute the SQL

### Option 3: Using Supabase CLI

```bash
supabase db push --file migrations/create_complete_purchase_order_receive_function.sql
```

## 📋 What the Fix Does

### Function: `complete_purchase_order_receive`

**Parameters:**
- `purchase_order_id_param` (UUID) - The PO to receive
- `user_id_param` (UUID) - User performing the receive
- `receive_notes` (TEXT, optional) - Notes about the receive

**Process:**

1. **Validation**
   ```sql
   -- Check PO exists
   -- Check status is receivable (shipped, partial_received, confirmed, sent)
   ```

2. **Create Inventory Items**
   ```sql
   -- For each PO item:
   --   Calculate quantity to receive (ordered - already received)
   --   Create inventory_items for each unit
   --   Include metadata (PO ID, item ID, received by, batch number)
   ```

3. **Update Records**
   ```sql
   -- Update purchase_order_items.quantity_received
   -- Update purchase_order.status to 'received'
   -- Create audit log entry
   ```

4. **Return Summary**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Successfully received X items",
     "data": {
       "items_created": 10,
       "total_items": 5,
       "total_ordered": 10,
       "received_date": "2025-01-20T...",
       "received_by": "user-id"
     }
   }
   ```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test Scenario 1: Complete Receive

1. Create a purchase order with 2 products, 5 units each
2. Mark as shipped
3. Make payment (status: paid)
4. Click "Receive Full Order"

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Order status changes to "received"
- ✅ 10 inventory items created
- ✅ Received Items tab shows 10 items
- ✅ Each item has correct metadata and cost price
- ✅ Audit log entry created

### Test Scenario 2: Partial Receive Flow

1. Create purchase order with 10 units
2. Partially receive 6 units
3. Run complete receive for remaining 4

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Only 4 new inventory items created
- ✅ Total received: 10 items
- ✅ No duplicates

### Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check inventory items were created
SELECT COUNT(*) as items_created
FROM inventory_items
WHERE purchase_order_id = 'your-po-id';

-- Check items have correct metadata
SELECT 
  serial_number,
  cost_price,
  status,
  metadata->>'batch_number' as batch,
  metadata->>'received_by' as received_by,
  notes
FROM inventory_items
WHERE purchase_order_id = 'your-po-id'
ORDER BY created_at;

-- Check PO status
SELECT 
  order_number,
  status,
  received_date,
  updated_at
FROM lats_purchase_orders
WHERE id = 'your-po-id';

-- Check audit log
SELECT 
  action,
  old_status,
  new_status,
  notes,
  created_at
FROM lats_purchase_order_audit_log
WHERE purchase_order_id = 'your-po-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Function still not found

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if function exists
SELECT proname, prosrc 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'complete_purchase_order_receive';

-- If not found, manually run the SQL from the migration file
```

### Issue: Permission denied

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Grant execute permission
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION complete_purchase_order_receive(UUID, UUID, TEXT) 
TO authenticated;
```

### Issue: Items created but not showing

**Check:**
1. Is `get_received_items_for_po` function working?
2. Are items in the correct database?
3. Check the console for error messages

```sql
-- Test the get function
SELECT * FROM get_received_items_for_po('your-po-id');
```

### Issue: Duplicate items created

**Prevention:**
The function checks `quantity_received` before creating items:
```sql
v_quantity := v_item_record.quantity_ordered - v_item_record.quantity_received;
```

If you have duplicates, they were created before this fix. Clean them up:
```sql
-- Find duplicates
SELECT purchase_order_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM inventory_items 
GROUP BY purchase_order_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > (
  SELECT SUM(quantity_ordered) 
  FROM lats_purchase_order_items 
  WHERE purchase_order_id = inventory_items.purchase_order_id
);
```

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Why This Happened

The frontend code was written to call `complete_purchase_order_receive`, but the database migration to create this function was never written or applied. The system has been working with other functions like:
- `get_received_items_for_po` ✓ (exists)
- `create_missing_inventory_items_for_po` ✓ (exists)

But the main receive function was missing.

### Future Improvements

Consider adding:
1. Transaction rollback on failure
2. Email notifications on successful receive
3. Automatic stock level updates
4. Integration with accounting systems
5. Barcode/QR code generation for each item

- [ ] Migration script runs without errors
- [ ] Function exists in database
- [ ] Test receive on a sample PO
- [ ] Inventory items are created
- [ ] Received items tab shows items
- [ ] Audit log entries are created
- [ ] No duplicate items created
- [ ] Console shows no errors

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console logs for error messages
2. Verify the function exists: `SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE '%complete_purchase%';`
3. Test the function directly with sample data
4. Check RLS policies on `inventory_items` table
5. Ensure user has proper permissions
