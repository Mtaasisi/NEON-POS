# ‚úÖ Branch + Shared Products Filter Fixed

## Problem Summary
Several services were filtering products/variants by `branch_id` **without including shared products** (`is_shared = true`), causing inconsistencies where:
- Main product queries showed shared products correctly ‚úÖ
- Live inventory metrics showed 0 products ‚ùå
- Real-time stock lookups failed ‚ùå

## Root Cause
Queries were using:
```typescript
query = query.eq('branch_id', currentBranchId);  // ‚ùå WRONG - Missing shared products
```

Should be:
```typescript
query = query.or(`branch_id.eq.${currentBranchId},is_shared.eq.true`);  // ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

## Files Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ `src/features/lats/lib/liveInventoryService.ts`
**Issue**: Live inventory metrics showing 0 products when shared products exist

**Fixed Lines**:
- **Line 77**: Products query now includes `is_shared` field
- **Line 79**: Changed from `.eq('branch_id', currentBranchId)` to `.or()`
- **Line 71**: Variants query now includes `is_shared` field
- **Line 79**: Changed from `.eq('branch_id', currentBranchId)` to `.or()`

**Impact**: 
- Live inventory metrics now correctly count shared products
- Total value, stock count, and product count are now accurate

### 2. ‚úÖ `src/features/lats/lib/realTimeStock.ts`
**Issue**: Real-time stock lookups failing for shared products in POS

**Fixed Lines**:
- **Line 74**: Added `branch_id, is_shared` to SELECT
- **Line 80**: Changed from `.eq('branch_id', currentBranchId)` to `.or()` for getStockLevels
- **Line 169**: Added `branch_id, is_shared` to SELECT for SKU lookup
- **Line 175**: Changed from `.eq('branch_id', currentBranchId)` to `.or()` for SKU lookup

**Impact**: 
- Barcode scanning now works for shared products across branches
- Stock levels correctly show for shared products in POS
- SKU lookups work correctly for shared inventory

## Verification

### Before Fix:
```
latsProductApi: Branch/shared products: 1 ‚úÖ
liveInventoryService: Fetched 0 products ‚ùå
```

### After Fix:
```
latsProductApi: Branch/shared products: 1 ‚úÖ
liveInventoryService: Fetched 1 products ‚úÖ
```

## Already Correct (No Changes Needed)
These files were already using the correct filtering logic:
- ‚úÖ `src/lib/latsProductApi.ts` - Main product query
- ‚úÖ `src/services/dashboardService.ts` - Dashboard low stock alerts
- ‚úÖ `src/features/lats/lib/data/provider.supabase.ts` - Uses latsProductApi

## Testing Instructions

1. **Refresh the app** (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Navigate to Inventory page**
3. **Check console logs**:
   ```
   liveInventoryService.ts: üîí ISOLATED MODE - Filtering by branch + shared products
   liveInventoryService.ts: üì¶ Fetched X products for live calculation
   liveInventoryService.ts: ‚úÖ Live metrics calculated: {totalProducts: X, ...}
   ```
4. **Verify POS**:
   - Scan barcode of a shared product
   - Should find stock correctly
5. **Check inventory metrics**:
   - Total value should be accurate
   - Product count should include shared products

## Branch Isolation Rules (Now Consistent Everywhere)

### ISOLATED Mode:
- Show products: `branch_id = current OR is_shared = true`
- Show variants: `branch_id = current OR is_shared = true`
- Show sales: `branch_id = current` (NOT shared)
- Show customers: `branch_id = current OR is_shared = true`

### SHARED Mode:
- Show all products from all branches
- No branch filtering applied

## Date Fixed
October 19, 2025

## Status
üéâ **COMPLETE** - All branch filtering inconsistencies resolved!
