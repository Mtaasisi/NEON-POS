## 📝 What About Advanced Features?

The **Advanced Features Toolbar** and all the new modals (Analytics, A/B Testing, Segmentation, etc.) are **NEW COMPONENTS** that need to be integrated into your WhatsApp page.

### They are NOT visible yet because:
- They exist as separate component files
- They need to be imported and added to WhatsAppInboxPage.tsx
- Integration takes ~30 minutes following the guide

### To See Advanced Features:
1. Follow the integration guide: `WHATSAPP_ADVANCED_FEATURES_INTEGRATION.md`
2. Or I can integrate them for you now
