## 🔧 What the Fix Does

The fix addresses potential issues in the stock transfer workflow:

### Problem Areas Fixed:

1. **Missing Database Functions**
   - Creates all required stock management functions
   - Ensures atomic transactions

2. **Variant Management**
   - Auto-creates variant at destination if missing
   - Handles SKU generation properly

3. **Stock Reservation**
   - Properly reserves stock when transfer created
   - Releases reservation when transfer completed

4. **Inventory Updates**
   - Reduces stock at source branch
   - Increases stock at destination branch
   - Updates in single atomic transaction

### Key Functions Installed:

1. `reserve_variant_stock` - Reserves stock for pending transfer
2. `release_variant_stock` - Releases reservation if cancelled
3. `reduce_variant_stock` - Reduces stock when transfer completes
4. `increase_variant_stock` - Increases stock at destination
5. `find_or_create_variant_at_branch` - Creates variant at destination if needed
6. `complete_stock_transfer_transaction` - Main function (handles entire receive process)

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x apply-stock-transfer-arusha-fix.mjs

# Run it
node apply-stock-transfer-arusha-fix.mjs
```

### Option 2: Manual

```bash
# Run SQL directly
psql "$VITE_DATABASE_URL" -f STOCK-TRANSFER-ARUSHA-FIX.sql
```

### Option 3: Database Client

1. Open your favorite database client (pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)
2. Connect to your database
3. Open `STOCK-TRANSFER-ARUSHA-FIX.sql`
4. Execute it

---

## ✅ Testing the Fix

Follow the guide in `MANUAL-TEST-STOCK-TRANSFER-ARUSHA.md`:

1. **Login** as `care@care.com` (password: `123456`)
2. **Create transfer** from Main Store to Arusha
3. **Approve** the transfer
4. **Switch to Arusha** branch
5. **Receive** the transfer
6. **Verify** inventory updated correctly

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Transfer:
```
Main Store:    Qty: 100, Reserved: 0
Arusha Branch: Qty: 0,   Reserved: 0
```

### After Creating Transfer (5 units):
```
Main Store:    Qty: 100, Reserved: 5   ← Stock reserved
Arusha Branch: Qty: 0,   Reserved: 0
Transfer Status: Pending
```

### After Approving Transfer:
```
Main Store:    Qty: 100, Reserved: 5   ← Still reserved
Arusha Branch: Qty: 0,   Reserved: 0
Transfer Status: Approved
```

### After Receiving Transfer at Arusha:
```
Main Store:    Qty: 95,  Reserved: 0   ← Reduced & released
Arusha Branch: Qty: 5,   Reserved: 0   ← Increased
Transfer Status: Completed
```

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Always test in a non-production environment first**
2. **Backup your database before applying fixes**
3. **Monitor the first few transfers closely**
4. **Check browser console for any errors**
5. **Verify inventory counts after each transfer**

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Review the troubleshooting section in testing guide
3. Verify database fix was applied successfully
4. Ensure you're on the correct branch
5. Confirm branches are active

---

## 🎉 What's Next?

After confirming the fix works:

1. **Test with real inventory** (not just test data)
2. **Train team members** on the workflow
3. **Document any branch-specific procedures**
4. **Monitor for edge cases**
5. **Consider adding email notifications** for transfers

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Database Transaction Flow:

```sql
BEGIN;
  -- Lock transfer record
  -- Validate status and branches
  -- Get current stock levels
  -- Find/create destination variant
  -- Reduce source stock + release reservation
  -- Increase destination stock
  -- Mark transfer completed
  -- Return detailed result
COMMIT;
```

### Security:

- All functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` for consistent permissions
- Validates branch status before processing
- Checks stock availability
- Atomic transactions prevent partial updates

### Performance:

- Uses row-level locking to prevent race conditions
- Minimal database queries
- Efficient JOIN operations
- Indexed lookups
