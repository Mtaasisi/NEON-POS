## Default Configuration

By default, all quick actions and widgets are **enabled**. This ensures that new users see the full functionality available before customizing.

## Performance Benefits

Disabling unused widgets and quick actions provides several benefits:

1. **Faster Page Load** - Fewer components to render
2. **Reduced Data Fetching** - Only enabled widgets fetch data
3. **Cleaner Interface** - Focus on what matters to you
4. **Better Mobile Experience** - Less scrolling on smaller screens

## Best Practices

### For Regular Users
- Start with all items enabled to understand what's available
- Gradually disable items you don't use frequently
- Keep at least 2-3 quick actions for easy navigation
- Maintain a balance of charts and widgets for comprehensive overview

### For Administrators
- Encourage team members to customize based on their roles
- Sales team might focus on financial and customer widgets
- Inventory managers might enable stock and purchase order features
- Service technicians might prioritize device and appointment widgets
