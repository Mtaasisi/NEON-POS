# 🐛 Customer Branch Assignment - Debug Logging Added

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Enhanced the customer creation process with **comprehensive debug logging** to track and verify branch assignment at every step.

## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `src/lib/customerApi/core.ts`

#### 1. **Branch Assignment Debug Section** (Lines 850-906)

Added detailed logging for the branch assignment process:

```javascript
console.log('🏪 BRANCH ASSIGNMENT PROCESS');
console.log('📍 Current Branch ID from localStorage:', currentBranchId || 'NOT SET');
```

**What it logs:**
- ✅ Whether a branch ID was found in localStorage
- ✅ Branch ID being assigned to `branch_id` field
- ✅ Branch ID being assigned to `created_by_branch_id` field
- ✅ Branch name lookup from database
- ✅ `is_shared` flag set to `false`
- ✅ Summary of all branch-related fields
- ⚠️ Warning if no branch is selected

#### 2. **Database Insert Debug Section** (Lines 922-1011)

Added comprehensive logging for the database insert:

**Before Insert:**
- 🆔 Customer identity (id, name, phone, email)
- 🏪 **Branch assignment (CRITICAL for filtering)**
  - `branch_id` - Must be set!
  - `is_shared` - Should be false
  - `created_by_branch_id` - Metadata
  - `created_by_branch_name` - Human-readable label
- 📊 Customer details (loyalty, points, etc.)
- 📄 Full JSON object being sent to database

**After Insert:**
- ✅ Confirmation that insert succeeded
- 🏪 **Branch Verification**
  - Checks if `branch_id` exists in returned data
  - Verifies all branch fields were saved
- 🚨 **Critical warnings** if branch_id is missing
- ✅ Success confirmation if branch is assigned

## 🎯 What You'll See Now

#### ❌ **Error Case (No Branch Selected):**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🏪 BRANCH ASSIGNMENT PROCESS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📍 Current Branch ID from localStorage: NOT SET
⚠️  No current branch ID found!
⚠️  Customer will be created WITHOUT branch assignment
⚠️  This customer will NOT appear in branch-filtered views
💡 Tip: Make sure a branch is selected before creating customers
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🏪 Branch Assignment (CRITICAL):
   - branch_id: ❌ NOT SET - CUSTOMER WILL BE INVISIBLE!
   - is_shared: ❌ NOT SET

🚨 CRITICAL WARNING 🚨
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
❌ Customer was created WITHOUT branch_id in database!
❌ This customer will NOT appear in branch-filtered queries!
❌ User will NOT see this customer in their customer list!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Possible causes:
  1. No branch selected (check localStorage.current_branch_id)
  2. Database column "branch_id" missing in customers table
  3. Database permissions preventing branch_id insert
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## 🔍 How to Use This Debug Info

### 1. **Check Branch Selection**

Look for this line in the console:
```
📍 Current Branch ID from localStorage: [branch-id or NOT SET]
```

- ✅ If you see a UUID → Branch is selected
- ❌ If you see "NOT SET" → No branch selected!

### 2. **Verify Branch Assignment**

Look for this section before insert:
```
🏪 Branch Assignment (CRITICAL):
   - branch_id: [should have a UUID]
   - is_shared: [should be false]
```

### 3. **Confirm Database Storage**

After insert, look for:
```
✅ BRANCH ASSIGNMENT VERIFIED IN DATABASE!
✅ Customer belongs to branch: [branch-id]
```

### 4. **Troubleshoot Issues**

If you see warnings:
1. Check if a branch is selected in the UI
2. Check browser console for localStorage.current_branch_id
3. Verify the customers table has branch_id column
4. Check database permissions

## 🎯 Key Fields to Watch

| Field | Purpose | Must Be Set? |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `branch_id` | **CRITICAL** - Used for filtering customers by branch | ✅ YES |
| `is_shared` | Whether customer is shared across branches | ✅ YES (should be false) |
| `created_by_branch_id` | Metadata - which branch created the customer | ⚪ Optional |
| `created_by_branch_name` | Human-readable branch label | ⚪ Optional |

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Instant visibility** - See exactly what's being sent to database
2. **Easy troubleshooting** - Clear warnings if something's wrong
3. **Verification** - Confirms branch assignment succeeded
4. **Audit trail** - Full JSON objects logged for debugging

## 📊 Field Mapping Reference

The code now properly maps these fields:

```javascript
branchId → branch_id
isShared → is_shared
createdByBranchId → created_by_branch_id
createdByBranchName → created_by_branch_name
```

## ✅ Testing

Try creating a customer and watch the console. You should see:

1. 🏪 Branch assignment section with all fields
2. 💾 Database insert section with JSON
3. ✅ Success confirmation with verification
4. ⚠️ Clear warnings if anything is missing
