---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Go to POS Page
Navigate to: `/lats/pos` or your POS route

### Step 3: Complete a Sale
1. **Add products to cart**
   - Search for a product
   - Click to add to cart
   - Add at least 1-2 items

2. **Process payment**
   - Click "Checkout" or payment button
   - Enter payment details
   - Click "Complete Payment"

3. **Watch for the modal! 🎉**
   - Should see a beautiful green modal
   - Message: "Payment of XXX TZS processed successfully! Sale #XXX"
   - Two buttons: "Print Receipt" and "New Sale"
   - Auto-closes in 3 seconds

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If modal doesn't appear:

**1. Check browser console (F12)**
Look for errors. Common issues:
- Import path errors
- Component not found
- React errors

**2. Check if payment succeeds**
- Does the sale get recorded?
- Does cart clear?
- Any error toasts?

**3. Try the test page first**
Add this to your App.tsx routes:
```tsx
import SuccessModalTest from './components/ui/SuccessModalTest';

<Route path="/test-modal" element={<SuccessModalTest />} />
```

Visit `/test-modal` and click buttons to verify modal works in isolation.

**4. Look for console logs**
When you complete a sale, check console for:
```
🟢 Modal state: true
```

If you don't see this, the `successModal.show()` isn't being called.

## 💡 Quick Debug

If it's not working, run this in browser console while on POS page:

```javascript
// Check if imports loaded
console.log('Success Modal loaded?', typeof SuccessModal);
console.log('Hook loaded?', typeof useSuccessModal);
console.log('Icons loaded?', typeof SuccessIcons);
```

Or try this to manually trigger:

```javascript
// Find the React component instance and call the hook manually
// (This is just for testing)
window.testSuccessModal = () => {
  alert('Check if this works first - if yes, the issue is in the flow');
};
window.testSuccessModal();
```

## 🎯 What Changed

### POSPageOptimized.tsx

**Added imports:**
```tsx
import SuccessModal from '../../../components/ui/SuccessModal';
import { useSuccessModal } from '../../../hooks/useSuccessModal';
import { SuccessIcons } from '../../../components/ui/SuccessModalIcons';
```

**Added hook:**
```tsx
const successModal = useSuccessModal();
```

**Replaced 3 toast.success calls:**
1. ZenoPay payment success (line ~1514)
2. Regular payment success (line ~1638)
3. Fallback payment success (line ~1696)

**Added modal to JSX:**
```tsx
<SuccessModal {...successModal.props} />
```
