## 🔴 Recommendations: What to Remove/Simplify

### 1. **REMOVE: Search & Filter Settings** ❌

**Why Remove:**

- Technical settings confuse non-technical users

**What to do instead:**
- Use smart defaults

**Impact:** Reduces complexity by 9%

### 2. **SIMPLIFY: Barcode Scanner** ⚙️

**Current Issues:**
- Too many settings for a simple feature
- Most settings should auto-detect
- Camera permissions handled by browser

**Simplify to:**
```
Barcode Scanner:
  [x] Enable Barcode Scanner
  [ ] Play sound on scan
  [ ] Show scan history
  
That's it!
```

**Impact:** 70% fewer options

---

### 3. **MERGE: Analytics & Reporting → Remove Tab** ❌

**Why Merge:**
- Analytics should always be ON
- Export options already in reports page
- No need for manual configuration

**What to do:**
- Enable all analytics by default
- Move export format to Reports page
- Delete this settings tab

**Impact:** One less tab to maintain

---

### 4. **SIMPLIFY: User Permissions** ⚙️

**Current Issues:**
- Too granular (50+ permissions)
- Most users just need 3 roles: Cashier, Manager, Admin
- Complex permission matrix confuses users

**Simplify to:**
```
User Permissions:
  
  Simple Mode (Recommended):
    - Cashier: Can sell, view products
    - Manager: + Can manage inventory, view reports
    - Admin: Full access
  
  Advanced Mode (for experts):
    - Custom permission configuration
```

**Impact:** 80% of users will use Simple Mode

### 5. **OPTIONAL: Make Delivery Tab** 🎯

**Why Optional:**
- Not all businesses do delivery

**What to do:**
```
Settings:
  [ ] Enable Delivery Features
  
  If enabled → Show delivery tab
  If disabled → Hide entirely
```

**Impact:** Cleaner UI for non-delivery businesses

---

### 6. **SIMPLIFY: Loyalty & Customer** ⚙️

**Current Issues:**
- Overlaps with Customers module
- Too many sub-features
- Confusing notification settings

**Simplify to:**
```
Customer Loyalty:

  Points: 1 point per TZS 100
  Redeem: 100 points = TZS 10 discount
  
  [x] Birthday rewards (50 points)
  [x] Referral rewards (100 points)
```

**Move customer management** → Customers page
**Move notifications** → Notifications tab

**Impact:** 60% simpler

---

### 7. **SIMPLIFY: Notifications** ⚙️

**Current Issues:**

    Notify via: [x] Email
```

**Impact:** Clear, action-oriented settings

---

### 8. **MERGE: Advanced → Remove Tab** ❌
