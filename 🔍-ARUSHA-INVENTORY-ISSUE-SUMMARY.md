# 🔍 ARUSHA Branch Inventory Issue - Summary

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL BUG FOUND**

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Products transferred to ARUSHA branch are **NOT showing in the inventory** even though they exist in the database.

---

## 🔬 Root Cause Analysis

### What's Happening:

```
When you transfer a product from Main Store → ARUSHA:

1. ✅ Transfer completes successfully
2. ✅ Stock is moved to ARUSHA branch
3. ✅ Variant is created at ARUSHA with correct quantity
4. ❌ Product is_shared stays = false
5. ❌ Frontend query excludes the product
6. ❌ ARUSHA inventory appears EMPTY!
```

### The Missing Piece:

The `complete_stock_transfer_transaction()` database function is **incomplete**. It's missing this critical code:

```sql
-- Mark product as shared (so it appears across branches)
UPDATE lats_products
SET is_shared = true
WHERE id = v_product_id;
```

### Why This Matters:

The frontend query in `liveInventoryService.ts` (lines 77-79) uses this logic:

```typescript
// Include shared products and products from current branch
productsQuery = productsQuery.or(`is_shared.eq.true,branch_id.eq.${currentBranchId}`);
```

This means it only shows products where:
- `is_shared = true` **OR**
- `branch_id = ARUSHA`

But transferred products have:
- `is_shared = false` ❌
- `branch_id = Main Store` (original branch) ❌

Result: **They don't match either condition, so they're hidden!**

---

## 🎯 The Solution

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic (Optional)

```bash
# In your Neon database SQL editor, run:
DIAGNOSE-ARUSHA-INVENTORY.sql
```

This will show you:
- How many products are affected
- Which products have stock at ARUSHA but aren't visible
- Current state of the database

### Step 2: Apply the Fix

```bash
# In your Neon database SQL editor, run:
FIX-ARUSHA-INVENTORY-COMPLETE.sql
```

This will:
1. ✅ Ensure `is_shared` column exists in both tables
2. ✅ Mark all existing multi-branch products as shared
3. ✅ **Update the transfer function to auto-share products**
4. ✅ Fix all future transfers automatically

### Step 3: Refresh & Test

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Switch to ARUSHA branch** using the branch selector
3. **Check inventory** - products should now be visible!

## 📋 What Gets Fixed

### Before Fix:
```
ARUSHA Inventory: 
  Products: 0 ❌
  (Even though database has variants with stock)
```

### After Fix:
```
ARUSHA Inventory:
  Products: All transferred products ✅
  Each showing ARUSHA's stock quantity
```

## 🔄 How It Works After Fix

### Product Visibility Logic:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BRANCH SELECTOR: ARUSHA                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Shows:                                              │
│  • Products with is_shared = true ✅              │
│  • Products with branch_id = ARUSHA               │
│                                                     │
│ Example: "Laptop XYZ"                              │
│  is_shared: true ✅                                │
│  Stock at ARUSHA: 2 units                          │
│  Stock at Main: 50 units                           │
│                                                     │
│ Result: ✅ VISIBLE (shows only ARUSHA stock)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Future Transfers:

All future stock transfers will **automatically**:
1. ✅ Move inventory from source to destination
2. ✅ Mark product as `is_shared = true`
3. ✅ Product appears in both branches
4. ✅ Each branch sees only their own quantity

## 🛠️ Files Involved

| File | Issue | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `liveInventoryService.ts` | ✅ Query logic is correct | No change needed |
| Database: `complete_stock_transfer_transaction()` | ❌ Missing auto-share code | **NEEDS FIX** |
| Database: `lats_products` table | May be missing `is_shared` column | Fix script handles it |
| Database: Product records | Existing products not marked shared | Fix script updates them |

---

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Check Existing Products
```sql
-- Run this after applying the fix
SELECT 
  p.name,
  p.is_shared,
  COUNT(pv.id) as variant_count,
  SUM(pv.quantity) as total_stock
FROM lats_products p
LEFT JOIN lats_product_variants pv ON pv.product_id = p.id
WHERE p.is_shared = true
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.is_shared;
```

You should see all transferred products with `is_shared = t`.

### Test 2: Make a New Transfer
1. Create a new transfer from Main → ARUSHA
2. Complete the transfer
3. Check in database:
```sql
SELECT is_shared FROM lats_products WHERE id = 'product-id';
-- Should return: true ✅
```

### Test 3: Check Frontend
1. Switch to ARUSHA branch
2. Open inventory page
3. You should see all products that have stock at ARUSHA

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Database Level:
```sql
-- All multi-branch products should be shared
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as shared_products
FROM lats_products 
WHERE is_shared = true;
-- Should match number of products with variants in multiple branches
```

### Frontend Level:
```
ARUSHA Inventory Page:
✅ Shows all products with ARUSHA variants
✅ Shows correct stock quantities for ARUSHA
✅ Each product displays properly
✅ No empty inventory error
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- [x] Diagnostic script created
- [x] Fix script created
- [ ] **Run `FIX-ARUSHA-INVENTORY-COMPLETE.sql`** ← YOU ARE HERE
- [ ] Verify products appear in ARUSHA inventory
- [ ] Test a new transfer
- [ ] Confirm auto-share works for new transfers

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Just run these 2 SQL scripts in order:**

1. **DIAGNOSE-ARUSHA-INVENTORY.sql** (optional, to see the problem)
2. **FIX-ARUSHA-INVENTORY-COMPLETE.sql** (required, to fix it)

Then refresh your browser and check ARUSHA inventory!

**Status:** 🔴 Awaiting fix application  
**Priority:** HIGH - Affects multi-branch inventory visibility  
**Impact:** All branches that receive transfers  

---

*This fix resolves the critical issue where the database function was incomplete and didn't mark products as shared during transfers, causing them to be invisible in destination branch inventories.*
