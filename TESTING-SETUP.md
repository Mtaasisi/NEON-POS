# 🧪 Automated Testing Setup Guide

## ⚠️ Browser Automation Not Available

The Playwright MCP server is **not currently connected** to your environment, so I cannot run automated browser tests directly. However, I've created comprehensive testing resources you can use.

## 📚 Testing Resources Created

### 1. **Manual Testing Guide** 
📄 `test-attendance-manual.md`

**Complete step-by-step manual testing guide:**
- Login as care@care.com
- Test all attendance page features
- Check for bugs
- Verify fixes
- Test results template

**Use this for:** Quick manual verification

---

### 2. **Automated Test Script**
📄 `tests/attendance.spec.ts`

**Playwright automation tests covering:**
- Login flow
- Page loading
- Real data display
- Tab navigation
- Monthly calendar
- Check-in/Check-out
- Error handling
- Mobile responsiveness
- Data persistence

**Use this for:** Automated regression testing

---

## 🚀 Quick Start: Manual Testing

### **Recommended: Do This First**

1. **Open your browser**
2. **Hard refresh** to clear cache:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
3. **Open** `test-attendance-manual.md`
4. **Follow** the step-by-step guide
5. **Test** login as care@care.com / 123456
6. **Verify** attendance page works

**This takes ~10 minutes and covers everything!**

## 🤖 Setup Automated Testing (Optional)

If you want to run the automated Playwright tests:

### Step 1: Install Playwright

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
```

### Step 2: Install Browsers

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### Step 3: Run Tests

```bash
# Run all attendance tests
npx playwright test tests/attendance.spec.ts

# Run with UI
npx playwright test tests/attendance.spec.ts --ui

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test tests/attendance.spec.ts --headed

# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/attendance.spec.ts -g "should load attendance page"
```

### Step 4: View Test Report

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

---

## 📝 Add to Package.json (Optional)

Add these scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:attendance": "playwright test tests/attendance.spec.ts",
    "test:attendance:ui": "playwright test tests/attendance.spec.ts --ui",
    "test:attendance:headed": "playwright test tests/attendance.spec.ts --headed",
    "test:attendance:report": "playwright show-report"
  }
}
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run test:attendance
```

## 🎯 What Should You Do Now?

### **Option 1: Quick Manual Test (Recommended)**

✅ **Best for:** Quick verification, fixing immediate issues

1. Open `test-attendance-manual.md`
2. Follow the guide
3. Test in ~10 minutes
4. Report any issues found

### **Option 2: Automated Testing**

✅ **Best for:** Continuous testing, regression testing

1. Install Playwright (`npm install -D @playwright/test`)
2. Run tests (`npx playwright test tests/attendance.spec.ts`)
3. View report
4. Fix any failures

### **Option 3: Both (Best Practice)**

✅ **Best for:** Complete confidence

1. Do manual test first (quick check)
2. Setup automated tests (for future)
3. Run automated tests regularly
4. Maintain both

## 🐛 If Tests Fail

### Common Issues:

**1. "loadData is not defined"**
- **Fix:** Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- **Reason:** Browser cache has old code

**2. "Infinite loading"**
- **Fix:** Already fixed in code, refresh
- **Reason:** Old cached JavaScript

**3. "Hardcoded data showing"**
- **Fix:** Hard refresh, check database has data
- **Reason:** Cache or no attendance records

**4. Tests can't login**
- **Fix:** Verify care@care.com exists with password 123456
- **Reason:** User not in database

**5. Tests timeout**
- **Fix:** Check app is running on localhost:5173
- **Reason:** App not running or different port
