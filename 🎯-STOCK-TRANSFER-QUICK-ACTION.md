## 🚨 Important Notes

### Current Branch: Main Store
The existing 3 transfers are all **OUTGOING** from Main Store to ARUSHA.

**To see Approve/Receive buttons**, you need to:
1. Be logged in to the RECEIVING branch (ARUSHA), OR
2. Create a new transfer going TO Main Store

**Why?**
- Sent transfers show: View Details button
- Received transfers show: Approve/Reject/Receive buttons
