## 🔧 Customize Test Data

Edit `auto-test-product-creation.mjs`:

```javascript
const TEST_PRODUCTS = [
  {
    name: `Your Product ${Date.now()}`,
    category: 'electronics',    // Change me
    condition: 'new',           // new/used/refurbished
    price: 99.99,              // Your price
    costPrice: 50.00,          // Your cost
    stockQuantity: 20,         // Your stock
    // ... more fields
  }
];
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Cannot connect to localhost:3000" | Run `npm run dev` first |
| "Playwright not found" | Run `npm run test:product:setup` |
| Test is too fast | Edit script: `SLOW_MO = 1000` |
| Want no browser window | Edit script: `headless: true` |

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Watch the browser** - Set `headless: false` to see what's happening
2. **Check HTML report first** - It's the easiest way to see results
3. **Screenshots are numbered** - Follow them in order
4. **Look for red text** - Error messages are usually red
5. **Compare before/after** - Screenshots 05 and 06 show the submit
