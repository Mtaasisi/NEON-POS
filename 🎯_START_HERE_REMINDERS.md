## 💡 PRO TIPS

### 1. **Start Small**
Don't try to implement everything at once. Start with the 5 critical reminders.

### 2. **Test Thoroughly**
Each reminder should be tested before going live. Wrong reminders are worse than no reminders.

### 3. **Get Staff Feedback**
Ask your team what reminders they need most. They'll use it more if they helped design it.

### 4. **Monitor & Adjust**
Watch which reminders get ignored vs acted upon. Adjust timing and content accordingly.

### 5. **Iterate Fast**
Launch basic version quickly, improve based on real usage. Don't wait for perfection.

## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: Will this create too many reminders?
**A**: No. System will create 20-50 reminders per day depending on business volume. Each reminder is meaningful and actionable.

### Q: Can I customize reminder times?
**A**: Yes! All reminder timings can be adjusted in settings or directly in the code.

### Q: What if a reminder fails to send?
**A**: System retries 3 times, then shows dashboard alert. You can also manually resend.

### Q: Can I disable certain reminder types?
**A**: Yes! Each reminder type can be enabled/disabled in settings.

### Q: Will customers get annoyed by SMS?
**A**: No. Each customer gets max 2-3 SMS per transaction (arrival notification + pickup reminder). All messages provide value.

### Q: How much will SMS cost?
**A**: Depends on your provider. Estimate 0.05-0.10 TZS per SMS. For 100 reminders/day = 5-10 TZS/day = 3,000-6,000 TZS/month. Worth it for improved customer experience!
