# 🔍 Which Product Creation Flow Are You Using?

## There are TWO different ways to create products:

### 1. 📦 Purchase Order → Add Product Modal
**Path**: Purchase Orders → Create PO → Add Product → Add New Product  
**URL**: `/lats/purchase-orders` → Click "Create New Purchase Order"  
**Code**: `AddProductModal.tsx` → Uses `useInventoryStore.createProduct` → **✅ MY FIX APPLIES HERE**

**Expected Behavior**:
- Product created with 0 prices initially
- Price entered later in ProductDetailModal
- Price saved when clicking "Add to Purchase Order"

---

### 2. 📝 Direct Add Product Page
**Path**: Main menu → LATS → Add Product  
**URL**: `/lats/add-product`  
**Code**: `AddProductPage.tsx` → Directly inserts to Supabase  
**Does NOT use the provider** → My fix doesn't apply here

**Expected Behavior**:
- Full form with price fields
- Price entered directly in the form
- Product created with prices immediately

## 🤔 Please Tell Me:

**Which flow are you using?**
- Option A: Purchase Order → Add Product Modal
- Option B: Direct Add Product Page (`/lats/add-product`)

**What exact issue are you seeing?**
- Products not being created at all?
- Products created but prices are 0?
- Products created but prices don't save when you enter them?
- Something else?

**Where are you checking for the price?**
- In the inventory list?
- In the product details popup?
- In the purchase order?
- In the database directly?

## 🔧 If Using Add Product Page

The Add Product Page uses a different code path that **directly inserts** to Supabase without using the provider. Let me check if there are issues there too:

**File**: `src/features/lats/pages/AddProductPage.tsx`
**Lines**: 638-641

```typescript
// Only set these fields if NOT using variants
cost_price: useVariants ? 0 : (formData.costPrice || 0),
unit_price: useVariants ? 0 : (formData.price || 0),
stock_quantity: useVariants ? 0 : (formData.stockQuantity || 0),
```

This looks correct - it should save prices when NOT using variants.

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Try creating a product
3. Look for these console messages:
   - `🔧 [Provider] Starting product creation...` (Purchase Order flow)
   - `Creating product with data:` (Add Product Page flow)

4. Share what you see in the console with me!
