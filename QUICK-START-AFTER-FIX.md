## 📞 Common Issues

### Console Shows "No products loaded"
- **Solution:** This is just a log message, not an error. Products will load momentarily.

### 400 Bad Request Errors
- **Solution:** These should be gone now. If you see them, clear browser cache.

### Page Loads Slowly First Time
- **Reason:** Neon database "cold start" (serverless waking up)
- **Solution:** Normal behavior. Subsequent loads will be fast.

### Data Not Showing
1. Check if you're logged in
2. Check if you have data in the database
3. Clear browser cache
4. Restart dev server
