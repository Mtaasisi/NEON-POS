# Trade-In Not Appearing in Inventory - Issue & Solutions

## 🔍 The Issue

After completing a trade-in transaction and payment, the traded-in device **does NOT appear in inventory automatically**. 

## 🎯 Why This Happens

The system has an **Admin Pricing Workflow** that requires manual confirmation before adding devices to inventory. This ensures:
- ✅ Accurate pricing for resale
- ✅ Additional costs (repairs, cleaning) are recorded
- ✅ Profit margins are properly set
- ✅ Quality control before listing

## 📋 The Correct Workflow

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Customer Trade-In** → Device assessed in POS
2. **Contract Signed** → Legal contract created
3. **Payment Completed** → Sale processed successfully
4. **🎯 PRICING MODAL OPENS** ← This is the missing step!
5. **Admin Sets Price** → Configure selling price
6. **Click "Confirm & Add to Inventory"** → Device added to inventory ✅

## ⚠️ Common Problem

**The Pricing Modal opens automatically after payment, but if:**
- ❌ It was closed without confirming
- ❌ It was missed/overlooked
- ❌ There was an error preventing it from opening

**→ The device remains pending and NOT in inventory**

## 🛠️ Solutions

### Solution 1: Check for Pending Trade-Ins

First, check if there are any trade-ins waiting to be added:

```bash
node check-pending-trade-ins.mjs
```

This will show you all trade-in transactions that haven't been added to inventory yet.

### Solution 2: Automatically Add to Inventory (Quick Fix)

If you have pending trade-ins and want to add them automatically with default pricing:

```bash
node add-pending-trade-ins-to-inventory.mjs
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Finds all pending trade-ins
- ✅ Creates products with SKU `TI-{IMEI}`
- ✅ Adds to "Trade-In Items" category
- ✅ Sets selling price at **30% markup** (default)
- ✅ Creates inventory items
- ✅ Records stock movements
- ✅ Links everything together

### Solution 3: Use the Pricing Modal Properly

For **future trade-ins**, make sure to:

1. **After payment completes**, watch for the **Pricing Modal**
2. **It looks like this:**
   - Shows device information (name, model, IMEI, condition)
   - Has fields for additional costs (repairs, cleaning, etc.)
   - Shows selling price calculator
   - Displays profit/loss analysis

3. **Fill in the details:**
   - Add any additional costs (optional)
   - Set the selling price (required)
   - Review profit margin
   - Click **"Confirm & Add to Inventory"**

4. **Device is now in inventory!** ✅

## 📊 What Gets Created in Inventory

When you confirm pricing (or run the auto-add script), the system creates:

### 1. **Product**
- Name: `{Device Name} - {Model} (Trade-In)`
- SKU: `TI-{IMEI}`
- Category: `Trade-In Items`
- Cost Price: Trade-in value + additional costs
- Selling Price: Your set price
- Stock: 1
- Status: Active (or Inactive if needs repair)

### 2. **Product Variant**
- Variant Name: `IMEI: {IMEI}`
- Contains all device details
- IMEI, serial number, condition
- Links to original trade-in transaction
- Links to original customer

### 3. **Inventory Item**
- Links product to branch
- Status: `available` or `needs_repair`
- Quantity: 1
- Notes: Trade-in details

### 4. **Stock Movement**
- Type: `trade_in`
- Quantity: +1
- Links to trade-in transaction
- Full audit trail

## 🎯 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check for pending trade-ins
node check-pending-trade-ins.mjs

# Auto-add all pending trade-ins (30% markup)
node add-pending-trade-ins-to-inventory.mjs
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Pricing modal doesn't open after payment
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. The modal should auto-open when there's a trade-in transaction.

### Issue: Can't see trade-in devices in inventory
**Solution:** 
1. Run `node check-pending-trade-ins.mjs` to see if they're pending
2. Run `node add-pending-trade-ins-to-inventory.mjs` to add them
3. Or complete the pricing step in POS

### Issue: Want to change default markup percentage
**Solution:** Edit `add-pending-trade-ins-to-inventory.mjs` and change:
```javascript
const DEFAULT_MARKUP = 30; // Change this to your desired percentage
```

### Issue: Device added but shows as "Inactive"
**Reason:** Device was marked as "needs repair" during assessment
**Solution:** 
1. Complete the repairs
2. Update repair status in Trade-In Management
3. Device will become active and sellable

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Always complete the pricing step** when the modal opens
2. **Add accurate additional costs** (repairs, cleaning, etc.) for proper profit tracking
3. **Set competitive selling prices** based on market conditions
4. **Review profit margins** before confirming
5. **For bulk pending trade-ins**, use the auto-add script

## 📝 Notes

- The auto-add script uses a **30% markup** by default
- You can edit prices later in the inventory management
- All additional costs are recorded as expenses
- Stock movements are tracked for full audit trail
- Trade-in devices appear in the "Trade-In Items" category

## 🚀 Quick Fix Right Now

If you have pending trade-ins right now:

```bash
# See what's pending
node check-pending-trade-ins.mjs

# Add them all with default pricing
node add-pending-trade-ins-to-inventory.mjs
```

Done! Your trade-in devices are now in inventory! 🎉
