# 🎯 Day Session Management - Setup Guide

## What This Does

Your POS now has **session-based day management**! Here's what changed:

### ✨ New Behavior

1. **When you close the day**: All transactions are saved and the day is marked as closed
2. **When you open a new day**: 
   - A fresh session starts
   - The counter resets to **TZS 0**
   - **Only NEW transactions** (made after opening) are shown
   - Previous transactions are archived and hidden

### 🔧 What Changed

1. **New Database Table**: `daily_opening_sessions` - tracks when each day is opened
2. **Session Tracking**: The POS now filters transactions by session start time
3. **Smart Display**: Sales counter only shows transactions from the current session

## 📋 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

You need to create the `daily_opening_sessions` table in your Neon database:

1. Open your Neon Database dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `setup-day-sessions.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the script

**OR** use the command line:

```bash
# If you have psql installed with your Neon connection string
psql "your-neon-connection-string" < setup-day-sessions.sql
```

### Step 2: Test the Feature

1. **Start your POS app**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Test the flow**:
   - Make a few test sales (you should see them counted)
   - Click "Close Day" button (passcode: `1234`)
   - The day closing modal will appear
   - After closing, the opening modal should appear
   - Enter passcode `1234` to open a new day
   - Notice: **The counter is now at TZS 0!**
   - Make new sales - only these new ones are counted
   - Previous sales are still in the database but not shown in current session

## 🎨 How It Works

### Session Flow

```
[Day Start] → Create Session
     ↓
[Make Sales] → Count only sales after session start time
     ↓
[Close Day] → Mark session inactive, save closure
     ↓
[Open New Day] → Create NEW session with new start time
     ↓
[Make Sales] → Count only sales from NEW session
```

### Database Structure

**`daily_opening_sessions`** table:
- `id`: Unique session ID
- `date`: Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `opened_at`: Timestamp when day was opened
- `opened_by`: User who opened the day
- `is_active`: Whether this session is currently active

**`daily_sales_closures`** table (updated):
- Added `session_id` to link closures with sessions

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Table doesn't exist" error

**Solution**: Make sure you ran the `setup-day-sessions.sql` migration in your database.

### Issue: Counter still shows old transactions

**Solution**: 
1. Close and reopen the day to create a fresh session
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Verify the session was created: Check `daily_opening_sessions` table

### Issue: Can't close/open day

**Solution**: Default passcode is `1234`. Make sure you're entering it correctly.

## 📊 Viewing Sessions in Database

To see all sessions:

```sql
SELECT * FROM daily_opening_sessions 
ORDER BY opened_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

To see current active session:

```sql
SELECT * FROM daily_opening_sessions 
WHERE is_active = true 
AND date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **Clean slate**: Each day starts fresh  
✅ **Accurate reporting**: No confusion about which sales belong to which session  
✅ **Better accounting**: Previous day's transactions are preserved but separate  
✅ **Audit trail**: Complete history of when days were opened/closed and by whom

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once you've tested and confirmed everything works:

1. Consider customizing the passcode (currently hardcoded as `1234`)
2. Add more session details (cash drawer amount, etc.)
3. Build reports that compare sessions/days
4. Add "View Previous Sessions" feature
