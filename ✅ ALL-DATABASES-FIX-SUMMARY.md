## 💡 Fixing the Development Database

You have 3 options:

### Option 1: Update Development Credentials (Recommended)
Get the correct credentials from your Neon dashboard and update `.env.development`:

1. Go to https://console.neon.tech
2. Find the development branch: `ep-dry-brook-ad3duuog`
3. Get the connection string
4. Update `.env.development` with the correct password

Then run:
```bash
node fix-all-databases.mjs
```

### Option 2: Use Production for Development
Point `.env.development` to the same database as production:

```bash
# Copy production URL to development
cp .env .env.development
```

**Note:** This means dev and production use the same database (not ideal but works)

### Option 3: Create a New Development Branch
1. Go to Neon dashboard
2. Create a new branch for development
3. Update `.env.development` with new credentials
4. Run `node fix-all-databases.mjs` again

## 📱 How to Test

### Test Production (Should Work ✅)
1. Make sure your app uses `.env` (production mode)
2. Refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Go to Customers page
4. Click "Add New Customer"
5. Fill in the form and submit
6. Should work without errors! 🎉

### Check Which Database Your App Uses
Look at your app's startup logs or check:
```bash
npm run dev
# Check the console output for which DATABASE_URL it's using
```

## 🚨 What If I Still Get Errors?

If you still see "Failed to create customer" after this fix:

### 1. Check which database your app is using
```bash
# In your app, check the environment
console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
```

### 2. Make sure you're using the fixed database
The fixed database is: `ep-damp-fire-adtxvumr`

If your app is using `ep-dry-brook-ad3duuog`, it won't work because that one failed to fix.

### 3. Hard refresh your browser
```
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### 4. Clear browser cache
Sometimes cached JavaScript can cause issues.

```

The script will:
- Find all databases in your .env files

## 📞 Next Steps

### If Production Works (Most Likely) ✅
You're all set! Just use your app normally.

### If You Need Development Database Too
1. Check Neon dashboard for correct credentials
2. Update `.env.development`
3. Run `node fix-all-databases.mjs` again

### If Neither Works
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Try to create a customer
3. Look for error messages
4. Check which database URL the app is trying to use
5. Share the error for more help

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Production Database: ✅ FIXED and WORKING**  
**Development Database: ❌ Needs correct credentials**  

Your main app should work now. The development database issue is likely just old/incorrect credentials in `.env.development`.

**Go ahead and test creating a customer in your POS app!** 🚀
