# Neon Database 400 Errors - Complete Fix (October 21, 2025) âœ…

## Problem
Multiple `POST https://api.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/sql 400 (Bad Request)` errors appearing in the browser console on the dashboard and other pages.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. âœ… Column "service_name" Does Not Exist Error

**File:** `src/services/dashboardService.ts` (Line 721)

**Issue:** The appointments query was trying to select a non-existent column `service_name`, when the actual column name in the database is `service_type`.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Wrong)
.select('id, customer_name, service_name, appointment_time, status, priority, technician_name')

// AFTER (Fixed)
.select('id, customer_name, service_type, appointment_time, status, priority, technician_name')
```

Also updated the mapping:
```typescript
// BEFORE
serviceName: apt.service_name || 'Service',

// AFTER
serviceName: apt.service_type || 'Service',
```

### 2. âœ… Syntax Error at or Near ":" in Customer Messages

**File:** `src/features/shared/components/dashboard/ChatWidget.tsx` (Lines 49-112)

**Issue:** The PostgREST relationship syntax `customers:customers!customer_id` was being incorrectly parsed by the Neon query builder, causing invalid SQL with colons to be generated.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed the problematic relationship join from the query
- Fetched customer data separately to avoid syntax issues
- Used separate queries with explicit column selection

```typescript
// BEFORE (Problematic relationship syntax)
.select(`
  id,
  customer_id,
  message,
  status,
  created_at,
  customers:customers!customer_id (
    id,
    name
  )
`)

// AFTER (Fixed - separate queries)
.select(`
  id,
  customer_id,
  message,
  status,
  created_at
`)

// Then fetch customer names separately
const { data: customersData } = await supabase
  .from('customers')
  .select('id, name')
  .in('id', uniqueCustomerIds);
```
