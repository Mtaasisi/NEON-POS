## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Column does not exist" error

**Solution**: You didn't run Step 1 (SQL script)
- Go back and run `🔧-FIX-ALL-MISSING-CUSTOMER-COLUMNS.sql`

### Problem: Fields still show as "undefined"

**Solution**: 
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify SQL script ran successfully
4. Confirm code deployed

---

### Problem: "Nothing changed"

**Solution**: 
- Existing customers may have NULL values for new fields
