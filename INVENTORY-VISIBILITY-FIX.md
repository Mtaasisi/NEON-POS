# ✅ FIXED: Inventory Not Showing After Stock Transfer

## 🐛 The Problem
You completed a stock transfer but couldn't see the updated inventory quantities on the Inventory page. You had to manually refresh the page to see changes.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The stock transfer system wasn't notifying the inventory page when stock quantities changed. The inventory page listens for `lats:stock.updated` events, but the transfer API wasn't emitting them.

## ✅ The Solution
Added event emissions to `stockTransferApi.ts` so the inventory page automatically refreshes when stock changes.

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Before (❌)
```
1. Complete a stock transfer
2. Navigate to Inventory page
3. ❌ Stock quantities are outdated
4. Must press F5 or click Refresh button
5. Finally see updated inventory
```

### After (✅)
```
1. Complete a stock transfer  
2. Navigate to Inventory page
3. ✅ Stock quantities already updated!
4. No manual refresh needed
5. See changes immediately
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Events Now Emitted

**1. Transfer Created** (reserves stock)
```typescript
latsEventBus.emit('lats:stock.updated', {
  variantId: transfer.entity_id,
  action: 'transfer_created',
  quantity: transfer.quantity,
  reserved: true
});
```
- Inventory shows stock as "reserved"
- Available quantity decreases
- Total quantity stays the same

**2. Transfer Completed** (moves stock between branches)
```typescript
latsEventBus.emit('lats:stock.updated', {
  variantId: transfer.entity_id,
  transferId: transferId,
  action: 'transfer_completed',
  fromBranchId: transfer.from_branch_id,
  toBranchId: transfer.to_branch_id,
  quantity: transfer.quantity
});
```
- Source branch: Total quantity decreases, reserved quantity released
- Destination branch: Total quantity increases

**3. Transfer Rejected** (releases reserved stock)
```typescript
latsEventBus.emit('lats:stock.updated', {
  variantId: transfer.entity_id,
  action: 'transfer_rejected',
  quantity: transfer.quantity,
  released: true
});
```
- Reserved quantity returns to available
- Stock becomes available for sale/transfer again

**4. Transfer Cancelled** (releases reserved stock)
```typescript
latsEventBus.emit('lats:stock.updated', {
  variantId: transfer.entity_id,
  action: 'transfer_cancelled',
  quantity: transfer.quantity,
  released: true
});
```
- Same as rejection - stock is released

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Transfer Completion
1. Open **two browser tabs** (or browsers):
   - Tab 1: Stock Transfer page
   - Tab 2: Inventory page

2. **Tab 1**: Create and complete a transfer
   - Login: care@care.com / 123456
   - Create transfer of 5 units to another branch
   - Approve → Mark In Transit → Complete

3. **Tab 2**: Switch to Inventory tab (DON'T refresh)
   - ✅ **Expected**: Stock quantities automatically update!
   - Source branch: Quantity decreased by 5
   - Destination branch: Quantity increased by 5 (if you switch branches)

### Test 2: Reserved Stock Display
1. Create a new transfer (don't complete it yet)
   - Product: Any product with stock
   - Quantity: 10 units

2. Go to Inventory page
   - ✅ **Expected**: See reserved stock:
     ```
     Available: 90 (decreased by 10)
     (10 reserved) ← Shows in orange/yellow
     Total: 100 units
     ```

3. Reject or cancel the transfer

4. Check Inventory page again (no refresh)
   - ✅ **Expected**: 
     ```
     Available: 100 (back to normal)
     (0 reserved)
     Total: 100 units
     ```

3. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check that both transfers and inventory are using the same product/variant

**To verify events are working:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
window.addEventListener('lats:stock.updated', (e) => {
  console.log('📦 Stock updated:', e.detail);
});
```
