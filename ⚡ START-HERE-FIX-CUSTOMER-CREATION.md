   - Paste it into the Neon SQL Editor

4. **Wait for Success:**

1. **Open your POS app** in the browser
2. **Open Developer Console:**

## 🔧 What Gets Fixed

The fix script will:

✅ Add missing `id` column to `customer_notes` table  
✅ Disable RLS (Row Level Security) that blocks inserts  
✅ Add missing columns: `whatsapp`, `created_by`, `referrals`, etc.  
✅ Fix `referrals` column type (JSONB instead of INTEGER)  
✅ Set proper default values for all fields  
✅ Test everything with a sample insert

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Password Issue
The automatic Node.js scripts cannot connect because:
- Database password in `.env.development` may be outdated
- Password authentication is failing

**Solution:** Use METHOD 1 (Copy-Paste SQL) which runs directly in Neon's dashboard using your logged-in session.

### After Running the Fix
1. **Refresh your app** (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. **Try creating a customer**
3. **Should see:** "Customer created successfully!" ✅

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

If customer creation still fails:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Press F12
   - Look for red error messages
   - Screenshot the error

2. **Check what error you see:**
   - "column does not exist" → Run the fix again
   - "permission denied" → RLS needs to be disabled
   - "null value violates constraint" → Missing default values

3. **Update Database Password:**
   - Go to Neon dashboard
   - Reset the database password
   - Update `.env.development` with new password
   - Try automatic fix again

4. **Verify Database Connection:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/mtaasisi/Downloads/POS-main NEON DATABASE"
   cat .env.development
   ```
   - Check if `DATABASE_URL` looks correct
   - Should start with: `postgresql://`
