# Payment Errors Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SQL Syntax Error - Duplicate NULL
**Error:** `syntax error at or near "NULL"` in query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM customer_payments WHERE device_id IS NOT NULL NULL ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 500
```

**Root Cause:** Incorrect use of `.filter()` method in Supabase query builder.

**Fix:** Changed from:
```javascript
.filter('device_id', 'IS NOT NULL', null)
```
To:
```javascript
.not('device_id', 'is', null)
```

**File:** `src/features/payments/components/PaymentTrackingDashboard.tsx` (lines 345, 347)

### 2. Missing Table - payment_providers
**Error:** `relation "payment_providers" does not exist`

**Root Cause:** The `payment_providers` table hasn't been created yet, but the code was trying to query it.

**Fix:** Changed the query to use `finance_accounts` table instead (which exists and has similar data):
```javascript
// Before:
supabase.from('payment_providers').select('*')

// After:
supabase.from('finance_accounts').select('*').eq('is_payment_method', true)
```

**File:** `src/features/payments/components/PaymentTrackingDashboard.tsx` (line 351)

### 3. Missing Column - currency in customer_payments
**Error:** `column "currency" does not exist`

**Root Cause:** The `customer_payments` table was missing the `currency` column which is needed for multi-currency support.

**Fix:** Created and ran a migration to add the currency column:
- Added `currency VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'TZS'` column
- Updated existing records to have default currency 'TZS'
- Added index for better query performance

**Migration:** `migrations/add_currency_to_customer_payments.sql`

## Verification

After these fixes, the following should work without errors:

1. ✅ Customer payments queries with device_id filters
2. ✅ Payment providers/finance accounts loading
3. ✅ Currency statistics and multi-currency payment tracking

## Next Steps

If you see any remaining errors:
1. Check the browser console for new error messages
2. Verify that the migration was applied to your database
3. Clear browser cache and reload the page
4. Check that all Supabase queries use the correct table and column names

## Files Modified

1. `src/features/payments/components/PaymentTrackingDashboard.tsx` - Fixed SQL syntax and table references
