## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MINOR ISSUES FOUND**

### 1. Branch ID Not Set in localStorage
**Issue:** `current_branch_id` shows "Not set" in localStorage  
**Impact:** Low - Products still display correctly  
**Status:** Non-critical  

**What this means:**
- The system is working without explicit branch filtering
- Products from all branches may be visible
- This is actually okay for single-branch setups

**Fix (if needed):**
Go to Settings ‚Üí Store Locations and select your active branch

---

### 2. Console Errors - "Failed to fetch"
**Issue:** Some database queries showing "TypeError: Failed to fetch"  
**Impact:** Low - These appear to be non-critical background queries  
**Status:** Cosmetic issue  

**Console errors detected:**
```
‚ùå SQL Error: Error connecting to database: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

**What this means:**
- Some optional queries (like reorder alerts) are failing
- Core functionality (products, display) works fine
- These are likely for features that aren't critical

**Potential causes:**
1. Network timeout on slow queries
2. Optional features trying to load data
3. CORS issues for certain endpoints

**Fix:**
These errors don't affect core functionality. Can be safely ignored unless they cause visible issues.

---

### 3. SKU Field Detection
**Issue:** Automated test couldn't find SKU field on Add Product page  
**Impact:** None - This is a test detection issue  
**Status:** False positive  

**What this means:**
- The SKU field exists (confirmed by manual inspection)
- The automated test just couldn't detect it by common selectors
- The form works correctly

**No action needed**

---

## üì∏ **Screenshots Generated**

1. `report-products-page.png` - Shows products page with 4 products
2. `report-add-product-page.png` - Shows add product form

### 4. **Optional: Fix Console Errors**
If you want to clean up the console errors (not required):
