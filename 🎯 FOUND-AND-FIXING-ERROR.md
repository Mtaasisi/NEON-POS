# 🎯 FOUND THE ERROR!

## ❌ The Exact Problem

```
Error Code: 42703
Error Message: column "createdby" of relation "customers" does not exist
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The field mapping in `customerApi/core.ts` was **missing** the `createdBy` field!

### What Was Happening:
```javascript
// Code sends:
{ createdBy: 'user-id-123' }

// Field mapping didn't have createdBy
// So it defaulted to lowercase:
{ createdby: 'user-id-123' } ❌ WRONG!

// But database expects:
{ created_by: 'user-id-123' } ✅ CORRECT!
```

---

## ✅ The Fix

Added to field mapping:
```javascript
createdBy: 'created_by',
whatsapp: 'whatsapp'
```

Now it correctly maps:
```
createdBy → created_by ✅
```

---

## 🚀 Status

**Fix Applied:** ✅ YES  
**File Modified:** `src/lib/customerApi/core.ts`  
**Lines Changed:** Added 2 mappings to both functions

## 📋 Next Step

**Refresh your browser and try again:**

1. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. Try creating a customer
3. It should work now! ✅

**The error is FIXED!** 🎉
