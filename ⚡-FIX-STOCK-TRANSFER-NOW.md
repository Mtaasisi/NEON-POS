# ‚ö° Stock Transfer & Inventory Fix - Action Plan

## üîç What I Found

Hey! I did a complete check of your stock transfer and inventory connection. Here's the deal:

### ‚ùå Critical Problems

**Problem #1: The main function is incomplete!**
- Your `complete_stock_transfer_transaction()` function only **reduces** stock from the source
- It **NEVER adds** stock to the destination
- **Result:** Every completed transfer makes inventory disappear! üí•

**Problem #2: Function signature mismatch**
- Your frontend sends 2 parameters: `(transfer_id, user_id)`
- But the basic setup function only accepts 1 parameter
- **Result:** Function calls will fail

**Problem #3: Missing helper functions**
- No `reserve_variant_stock()` - can't reserve stock for pending transfers
- No `release_variant_stock()` - can't release when cancelled
- No `find_or_create_variant_at_branch()` - can't create variant at destination
- **Result:** Limited functionality, no stock protection

**Problem #4: Missing `reserved_quantity` column**
- The `lats_product_variants` table might not have `reserved_quantity`
- **Result:** Can't track pending transfers, risk of overselling

**Problem #5: Incomplete audit trail**
- Only logs outgoing movement, not incoming
- **Result:** No record at destination branch

## ‚úÖ The Good News

You **already have** a complete fix file in your codebase! üéâ

The file `üîß-COMPLETE-STOCK-TRANSFER-FIX.sql` contains:
- ‚úÖ All 7 necessary functions
- ‚úÖ Proper 2-parameter signature
- ‚úÖ Complete stock movement (reduces source + increases destination)
- ‚úÖ Stock reservation system
- ‚úÖ Full audit trail (2 movement logs)
- ‚úÖ All required columns

---

## üöÄ How to Fix (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Run the Diagnostic (Optional but Recommended)

This will show you exactly what's wrong in your database:

```bash
# In your Neon SQL Editor, run:
DIAGNOSTIC-STOCK-TRANSFER-CHECK.sql
```

This will tell you:
- Which functions are missing
- Which columns are missing
- Current transfer status
- Reservation status

### Step 2: Apply the Complete Fix

Run this ONE file to fix everything:

```bash
# In your Neon SQL Editor, run:
üîß-COMPLETE-STOCK-TRANSFER-FIX.sql
```

**What this fixes:**
1. ‚úÖ Adds `reserved_quantity` column
2. ‚úÖ Adds branch tracking to stock movements
3. ‚úÖ Creates `reserve_variant_stock()` function
4. ‚úÖ Creates `release_variant_stock()` function
5. ‚úÖ Creates `find_or_create_variant_at_branch()` function
6. ‚úÖ Creates `check_duplicate_transfer()` function
7. ‚úÖ **Fixes `complete_stock_transfer_transaction()` with:**
   - 2 parameters (transfer_id, completed_by)
   - Reduces stock from source ‚úÖ
   - Increases stock at destination ‚úÖ
   - Logs both movements ‚úÖ
   - Releases reservation ‚úÖ
   - Atomic transaction (all-or-nothing) ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNING

**DO NOT complete any transfers before applying the fix!**

If you complete transfers with the broken function:
- Stock will be removed from source ‚úÖ
- Stock will NOT be added to destination ‚ùå
- Inventory will disappear permanently! üí•

According to your docs, you have:
- 2 approved transfers waiting
- 4 units of stock reserved

If you complete these now, **you'll lose 4 units of inventory!**

## üìã Verification After Fix

After running the fix, verify it worked:

### Check 1: Function Signature
```sql
SELECT 
  routine_name,
  parameter_name,
  data_type,
  ordinal_position
FROM information_schema.parameters
WHERE specific_name IN (
  SELECT specific_name 
  FROM information_schema.routines 
  WHERE routine_name = 'complete_stock_transfer_transaction'
)
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
routine_name                         | parameter_name  | data_type | position
-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------
complete_stock_transfer_transaction  | p_transfer_id   | uuid      | 1
complete_stock_transfer_transaction  | p_completed_by  | uuid      | 2
```

### Check 2: Reserved Quantity Column
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'lats_product_variants'
  AND column_name = 'reserved_quantity';
```

**Expected Result:**
```
column_name        | data_type | column_default
-------------------|-----------|----------------
reserved_quantity  | integer   | 0
```

### Check 3: Test with Small Transfer

1. Create a test transfer (1 unit)
2. Note stock levels at both branches
3. Complete the transfer
4. Verify:
   - Source: stock reduced by 1 ‚úÖ
   - Destination: stock increased by 1 ‚úÖ
   - Stock movements: 2 entries (out + in) ‚úÖ

```sql
-- Check stock before
SELECT 
  pv.id,
  pv.variant_name,
  pv.quantity,
  pv.reserved_quantity,
  sl.name as branch
FROM lats_product_variants pv
JOIN store_locations sl ON pv.branch_id = sl.id
WHERE pv.id IN ('source_variant_id', 'dest_variant_id');

-- Complete transfer (in app or via API)

-- Check stock after
SELECT 
  pv.id,
  pv.variant_name,
  pv.quantity,
  pv.reserved_quantity,
  sl.name as branch
FROM lats_product_variants pv
JOIN store_locations sl ON pv.branch_id = sl.id
WHERE pv.id IN ('source_variant_id', 'dest_variant_id');

-- Check movements
SELECT 
  movement_type,
  quantity,
  previous_quantity,
  new_quantity,
  from_b.name as from_branch,
  to_b.name as to_branch
FROM lats_stock_movements sm
LEFT JOIN store_locations from_b ON sm.from_branch_id = from_b.id
LEFT JOIN store_locations to_b ON sm.to_branch_id = to_b.id
WHERE reference_id = 'transfer_id'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

## üéØ After the Fix: How It Works

### Stock Transfer Workflow

1. **Create Transfer** (Status: `pending`)
   ```
   Source: quantity stays same, reserved_quantity increases
   Destination: no change
   ```

2. **Approve Transfer** (Status: `approved`)
   ```
   Source: stock still reserved
   Destination: no change
   (Waiting for completion)
   ```

3. **Complete Transfer** (Status: `completed`) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **THIS NOW WORKS!**
   ```
   Source: 
     - quantity decreases (actual reduction)
     - reserved_quantity decreases (release reservation)
   
   Destination:
     - quantity increases (stock arrives!)
     - variant created if doesn't exist
   
   Audit Trail:
     - Movement log 1: Source -qty
     - Movement log 2: Destination +qty
   ```

4. **Cancel/Reject** (Status: `cancelled`/`rejected`)
   ```
   Source: reserved_quantity decreases (release)
   Destination: no change
   No inventory movement
   ```

## üìä What Each Function Does

| Function | Purpose | When Called |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `reserve_variant_stock()` | Lock stock for transfer | On create |
| `release_variant_stock()` | Unlock stock | On cancel/reject |
| `reduce_variant_stock()` | Remove stock from variant | On complete (source) |
| `increase_variant_stock()` | Add stock to variant | On complete (destination) |
| `find_or_create_variant_at_branch()` | Find/create variant at dest | On complete |
| `check_duplicate_transfer()` | Prevent duplicates | On create |
| `complete_stock_transfer_transaction()` | **Main orchestrator** | On complete |

## üîê Safety Features (After Fix)

1. **Atomic Transactions**
   - All updates happen together or none at all
   - Can't have partial failures

2. **Row Locking**
   - Prevents concurrent modifications
   - No race conditions

3. **Stock Reservation**
   - Pending transfers lock stock
   - Can't oversell reserved stock

4. **Audit Trail**
   - Every movement logged
   - Can reconcile inventory

5. **Validation**
   - Branch must exist and be active
   - Transfer must be approved first
   - Stock levels checked
