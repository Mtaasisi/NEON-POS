4. ✅ **Filter employees** by branch/store
5. ✅ **Validation** prevents creating employee without branch
6. ✅ **Visual indicators** for branch (icon + emoji for main)

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Database Schema Requirements

The implementation assumes the following database structure exists:

```sql
-- Employees table should have:
ALTER TABLE employees 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS branch_id UUID 
REFERENCES store_locations(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employees_branch_id 
ON employees(branch_id);

-- Store locations table (should exist):
-- store_locations(id, name, code, is_main, is_active, ...)
```

### API Endpoints Used

```typescript
// Employee Service Methods
employeeService.getAllEmployees()           // Returns employees with branch join
employeeService.getEmployeeById(id)          // Returns employee with branch
employeeService.getEmployeesByBranch(branchId) // Filter by branch
employeeService.createEmployee(data)          // Create with branchId
employeeService.updateEmployee(id, data)      // Update including branchId
employeeService.assignEmployeeToBranch(empId, branchId) // Assign branch
employeeService.removeEmployeeFromBranch(empId) // Remove branch
```

### Component Dependencies

```
BranchSelector
├── GlassSelect (UI component)
├── supabase (database client)
└── MapPin (Lucide icon)

EmployeeForm
├── BranchSelector
├── GlassCard
├── GlassButton
└── GlassSelect

EmployeeManagementPage
├── EmployeeForm
├── GlassSelect (for filters)
├── supabase
└── employeeService
```

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED

### New Files:
1. `src/components/BranchSelector.tsx` ✨ NEW
2. `test-branch-integration.md` ✨ NEW (this will be created)
3. `BRANCH-INTEGRATION-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md` ✨ NEW (this file)

### Modified Files:
1. `src/services/employeeService.ts`
2. `src/features/employees/components/EmployeeForm.tsx`
3. `src/features/employees/pages/EmployeeManagementPage.tsx`

## 🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Prerequisites:
1. ✅ Database has `store_locations` table with active branches
2. ✅ Database has `branch_id` column in `employees` table
3. ✅ Application is running (`npm run dev`)
4. ✅ User is logged in as admin or manager

### Test Steps:

#### Test 1: Create Employee with Branch
```
1. Go to /employees
2. Click "Add Employee"
3. Fill all fields including branch selector
4. Submit form
5. Verify employee appears with branch in table
```

#### Test 2: Edit Employee Branch
```
1. Click Edit on an employee
2. Change branch selection
3. Save changes
4. Verify branch updated in table
```

#### Test 3: Filter by Branch
```
1. Use "Filter by Branch" dropdown
2. Select a specific branch
3. Verify only employees from that branch show
4. Select "All Branches"
5. Verify all employees show again
```

#### Test 4: Validation
```
1. Try creating employee without selecting branch
2. Verify error message appears
3. Verify form won't submit
```

## 🚨 POTENTIAL ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: "Branch/Store selector shows no branches"
**Solution:**
- Go to Settings → Store Management
- Create at least one branch
- Ensure branch is marked as `is_active = true`

### Issue 2: "Branch column shows 'Unassigned' for all employees"
**Solution:**
- Database might not have `branch_id` column
- Run the migration SQL:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE employees 
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS branch_id UUID 
  REFERENCES store_locations(id);
  ```

### Issue 3: "Cannot select branch in form"
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify supabase connection is working
- Check that `store_locations` table exists

### Issue 4: "Branch filter doesn't work"
**Solution:**
- Verify employees have `branch_id` set
- Check console for filtering errors
- Ensure state is updating correctly
