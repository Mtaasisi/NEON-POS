## Technical Details

### Where Employee Preferences are Stored
- Employee's choice is saved in **browser localStorage**
- Key: `employeeSecurityMode`
- Persists across sessions
- Per-device (different on phone vs laptop)

### What Happens When Admin Changes Settings

**If admin DISABLES employee choice:**
- All employees forced to use default mode
- Their saved preferences are ignored
- "Change" button disappears immediately

**If admin changes available modes:**
- Employees using unavailable mode are reset to default
- They see updated options on next check-in

**If admin changes default mode:**
- Only affects employees who haven't chosen yet
- Existing choices are preserved

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I enabled employee choice but they don't see the Change button"
✅ Make sure you clicked **"Save Settings"** in admin panel
✅ Employee needs to refresh the page
✅ Check that `allowEmployeeChoice` is true in settings

### "Employee's choice isn't being saved"
✅ Check browser localStorage is enabled
✅ Verify they're not in incognito/private mode
✅ Try clearing browser cache and re-selecting

### "Some modes don't appear in the list"
✅ Only modes you checked in admin settings appear
✅ Make sure you saved your changes
✅ Verify `availableSecurityModes` array includes the mode

### "Everyone is forced to use one mode"
✅ Check if `allowEmployeeChoice` toggle is ON
✅ Verify at least one mode is checked in available modes
✅ Save settings and refresh employee pages

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Enable employee choice for flexibility
- Select 2-3 security modes (not all 6)
- Set Auto-Location as default
- Test each mode before enabling
- Communicate options to employees
- Review security needs quarterly

### ❌ DON'T:
- Enable all 6 modes (too confusing)
- Enable Photo Only for office workers
- Change modes frequently (disrupts workflow)
- Force high-security mode without WiFi infrastructure
- Forget to save your admin settings!

---

## Quick Start Guide

### For Flexible Security (Recommended):
1. Go to Admin → Settings → Attendance
2. Toggle **"Allow Employees to Choose"** ON
3. Check: Auto-Location, Manual Location, WiFi Only
4. Set Default: Auto-Location
5. Click **Save Settings**

### For Strict Security:
1. Go to Admin → Settings → Attendance

---

## Migration from Old System

If you were using the old single-mode system:
- ✅ Your existing `securityMode` is now `defaultSecurityMode`
- ✅ `allowEmployeeChoice` defaults to `true`
- ✅ All modes are available by default
- ✅ No database migration needed!
- ✅ Everything works automatically

---

## Files Modified

✅ `src/lib/attendanceSettingsApi.ts` - Added employee choice settings
✅ `src/features/admin/pages/AdminSettingsPage.tsx` - New admin UI
✅ `src/features/employees/components/SecureAttendanceVerification.tsx` - Employee selector

---

## Summary

🎯 **You now have complete control!**
- Let employees choose what works for them
- Or enforce one method for consistency
- Select which methods are available
- Set a sensible default
- Change anytime without disrupting employees

**This is the most flexible attendance security system possible! 🚀**
