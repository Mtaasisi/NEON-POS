## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Employee Record Missing
**Problem**: User care@care.com did not have an associated employee record in the database, causing the attendance page to show an error: "Employee record not found. Please contact your administrator."

**Root Cause**: The attendance page requires the logged-in user to have an employee record linked via `user_id` foreign key.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Created SQL script: `FIX-ATTENDANCE-CREATE-EMPLOYEE.sql`
- Executed script to create employee record for care@care.com
- Employee Details:
  - Name: Care Team
  - Position: Customer Care Specialist
  - Department: Customer Service
  - Status: Active
  - Employee ID: fa708e58-942c-4c5b-8969-d0a941f12764
  - User ID: 287ec561-d5f2-4113-840e-e9335b9d3f69

**Result**: ✅ Issue resolved, attendance page now loads correctly

### Issue #2: Test Script Variable Scope Error
**Problem**: Test script had a bug where `rowCount` variable was used before declaration

**Fix Applied**: 
- Declared `rowCount` variable before the conditional block
- Initialized to 0 to handle cases where table is not present

**Result**: ✅ Test script now runs without errors
