## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Modified:
- `src/features/lats/components/pos/POSSettingsModal.tsx`

### Changes Made:

```typescript
// 1. Import Auth Context
import { useAuth } from '../../../../context/AuthContext';

// 2. Get Current User Role
const { currentUser } = useAuth();
const userRole = currentUser?.role || 'customer-care';
const isAdmin = userRole === 'admin';

// 3. Add roles to each tab
const allSettingsTabs = useMemo(() => [
  { id: 'general', name: '🏪 General', ..., roles: ['admin'] },
  { id: 'pricing', name: '💰 Pricing & Discounts', ..., roles: ['admin'] },
  { id: 'receipt', name: '🧾 Receipts', ..., roles: ['admin', 'customer-care'] },
  { id: 'notifications', name: '📢 Notifications', ..., roles: ['admin', 'customer-care'] },
  { id: 'features', name: '📦 Features', ..., roles: ['admin'] },
  { id: 'permissions', name: '👥 Users & Permissions', ..., roles: ['admin'] }
], []);

// 4. Filter tabs based on role
const settingsTabs = useMemo(() => {
  return allSettingsTabs.filter(tab => tab.roles.includes(userRole));
}, [allSettingsTabs, userRole]);
```
