# üîß FIXES APPLIED - Console Errors Resolved

## ‚úÖ **Issue #1: Date Format Error - FIXED**

### Problem:
```
The specified value "Sun Oct 12 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0300 (East Africa Time)" 
does not conform to the required format, "yyyy-MM-dd"
```

### Cause:
The `hireDate` field in EmployeeForm was being initialized with a Date object that wasn't properly formatted for HTML5 date inputs.

### Solution:
Updated `EmployeeForm.tsx` to format dates correctly:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect):
hireDate: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]

// After (correct):
const today = new Date();
const defaultHireDate = `${today.getFullYear()}-${String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')}-${String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0')}`;
hireDate: defaultHireDate
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Date format error is now fixed - no more console warnings

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue #2: User-Employee Link Errors - INFORMATIONAL**

### Errors Shown:
```
Error getting user-employee links: {data: null, error: {‚Ä¶}, count: null}
Error getting unlinked users: {data: null, error: {‚Ä¶}, count: null}
```

### Cause:
These errors occur in the `UserEmployeeLinkModal` component when trying to query database views/tables that may not exist or have different schema.

### Impact:
- **Does NOT affect Employee Management** ‚úÖ
- **Does NOT affect Branch integration** ‚úÖ
- Only affects the "User-Employee Links" feature button

### When Do These Errors Appear:
- When clicking "User-Employee Links" button in User Management page
- On component mount when the modal tries to load data

### Solution Options:

**Option 1: Ignore (Recommended for now)**
- These errors don't affect the branch/store integration
- Employee Management works perfectly without this feature
- Can be addressed separately later

**Option 2: Hide the Button**
- Remove or hide "User-Employee Links" button if feature not needed
- Located in: `src/features/users/pages/UserManagementPage.tsx` around line 498-505

**Option 3: Fix Database Schema**
- Requires creating proper database views/tables for user-employee linking
- More complex fix requiring database migration
