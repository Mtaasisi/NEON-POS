-- 4Ô∏è‚É£ BRANCH LIST: All active branches

-- üí° INTERPRETATION:
-- ============================================
-- If Main Store shows 0 sales ‚Üí That's why you see "SALES RETURNED: 0"
-- If ARUSHA/Airport show sales ‚Üí Switch to those branches to see them
-- If many sales are UNASSIGNED ‚Üí Run migration to assign them
