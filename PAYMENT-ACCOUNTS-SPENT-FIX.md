# 💰 Payment Accounts "Spent" Amount Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The Payment Accounts page now properly tracks and displays **all outgoing transactions** (spent amounts) for each account.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Transaction Type Tracking

**File:** `src/features/payments/components/PaymentAccountManagement.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const totalReceived = allTransactions
  ?.filter(t => t.transaction_type === 'payment_received')
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + Number(t.amount), 0) || 0;

const totalSpent = allTransactions
  ?.filter(t => t.transaction_type === 'payment_made' || t.transaction_type === 'expense')
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + Number(t.amount), 0) || 0;
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Transaction types that increase balance (money in)
const totalReceived = allTransactions
  ?.filter(t => t.transaction_type === 'payment_received' || t.transaction_type === 'transfer_in')
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + Number(t.amount), 0) || 0;

// Transaction types that decrease balance (money out)
const totalSpent = allTransactions
  ?.filter(t => 
    t.transaction_type === 'payment_made' || 
    t.transaction_type === 'expense' || 
    t.transaction_type === 'transfer_out'
  )
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + Number(t.amount), 0) || 0;
```

#### 2. Updated Recent Activity Display

**Before:** Only showed `payment_received` as green (positive)

**After:** Shows both `payment_received` and `transfer_in` as green (positive), all others as red (negative)

## 📊 Transaction Types Explained

### Money IN (Increases Balance) - Shows as Green +
1. **`payment_received`** - Money received from sales, customer payments
   - Example: POS sales, mobile money payments, bank transfers
   
2. **`transfer_in`** - Money transferred into this account from another account
   - Example: Moving money from savings to cash drawer

### Money OUT (Decreases Balance) - Shows as Red -
1. **`payment_made`** - Payments sent to suppliers, vendors, or others
   - Example: Paying supplier invoices, purchase order payments
   
2. **`expense`** - Business expenses paid
   - Example: Rent, utilities, salaries, supplies
   
3. **`transfer_out`** - Money transferred from this account to another account
   - Example: Moving money from cash to bank

### Other
4. **`adjustment`** - Manual balance adjustments (can be + or -)
   - Example: Correcting errors, reconciliation adjustments

## 🔍 Why "Spent" Shows TSh 0

If your accounts still show **"Spent: TSh 0"**, it means you have **NO outgoing transactions** in your database yet.

### To Verify:
Run the diagnostic SQL script:
```bash
DIAGNOSE-PAYMENT-ACCOUNT-TRANSACTIONS.sql
```

This will show you:
- All transaction types in your database
- Received vs Spent summary for each account
- Recent transactions
- Why "Spent" shows TSh 0 (if applicable)

## 💡 How to Create "Spent" Transactions

### Option 1: Record Business Expenses
1. Navigate to **Finance** → **Expenses**
2. Click **Add Expense**
3. Fill in expense details
4. Select the payment account that paid the expense
5. Save - this creates an `expense` transaction

### Option 2: Make Supplier Payments
1. Navigate to **LATS** → **Purchase Orders**
2. Select a purchase order
3. Click **Add Payment**
4. Select the payment account
5. Enter payment amount
6. Save - this creates a `payment_made` transaction

### Option 3: Transfer Between Accounts
1. Navigate to **Finance** → **Accounts**
2. Click **Transfer Money**
3. Select **From Account** (creates `transfer_out`)
4. Select **To Account** (creates `transfer_in`)
5. Enter amount and confirm

### Option 4: Manual Entry (Advanced)
Use the account_transactions table directly:

```sql
-- Example: Record a TSh 50,000 expense paid from Cash account
INSERT INTO account_transactions (
  account_id,
  transaction_type,
  amount,
  description,
  reference_number,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '{{cash_account_id}}',
  'expense',
  50000,
  'Office supplies',
  'EXP-001',
  NOW()
);
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### 1. Check Current State
Navigate to: **Finance** → **Payment Accounts**

You should see:
- ✅ **Received**: Shows correct amounts (from sales)
- ✅ **Spent**: Now includes ALL outgoing transactions
- ✅ **Current Balance** = Received - Spent

### 2. Create a Test Expense
1. Add a small expense (e.g., TSh 1,000)
2. Select a payment account (e.g., Cash)
3. Refresh the Payment Accounts page
4. Verify:
   - "Spent" increased by TSh 1,000
   - "Current Balance" decreased by TSh 1,000

### 3. Verify Calculation
```
Expected Balance = Total Received - Total Spent

Example for Cash Account:
- Received: TSh 58,925
- Spent: TSh 1,000 (from test expense)
- Balance: TSh 57,925 ✅
```

## 📈 Example Data

### Before Fix
```
CRDB Bank:
  Current Balance: TSh 1,502,930
  Received: TSh 1,502,930

```

### After Fix (with some expenses)
```
