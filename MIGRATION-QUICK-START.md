# ⚡ Quick Start: Migrate Database Changes

## 🎯 Goal
Copy all schema changes from **Development** to **Production**

## 🔄 Three Ways to Migrate

### 🥇 Method 1: Neon Branch Promotion (EASIEST)

**⏱️ Time: 2 minutes**

```
1. Go to: https://console.neon.tech
2. Select your project
3. Click "Branches"
4. Find: ep-dry-brook-ad3duuog (dev)
5. Click "Promote to Primary"
6. Done! ✅
```

**✅ Pros:**
- One-click solution
- Automatic backup created
- Zero downtime
- Can't mess up

**❌ Cons:**
- Endpoint names swap (need to update .env)

---

### 🥈 Method 2: Auto-Compare Script (SAFE)

**⏱️ Time: 10 minutes**

```bash
# Run the comparison script
./compare-schemas.sh

# It will show you what changed
# Then create a migration file manually

# Test on a branch first
# Apply to production when ready
```

**✅ Pros:**
- See exactly what changed
- Full control
- Test before applying

**❌ Cons:**
- Need PostgreSQL tools installed
- More manual work

---

### 🥉 Method 3: Manual SQL Export (ADVANCED)

**⏱️ Time: 30+ minutes**

Only use if you need fine-grained control.

## 🚀 Recommended: Method 1 (Branch Promotion)

This is the **safest and fastest** way:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Open Neon Console**
   ```
   https://console.neon.tech
   ```

2. **Go to Your Project**

3. **Navigate to Branches Tab**

4. **Find Development Branch**
   - Name: `ep-dry-brook-ad3duuog`

5. **Click "Promote to Primary" or "Set as Primary"**
   - This makes your dev branch the new main
   - Your old production becomes a backup branch
   - All changes copied instantly

6. **Update Connection Strings**
   - The endpoint names will swap
   - Update `.env.production`:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_vABqUKk73tEW@ep-dry-brook-ad3duuog-pooler.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```

7. **Test Your App**
   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   npm run preview
   ```

8. **Deploy!** 🎉

## 📊 What Gets Migrated

Everything in your dev branch:
- ✅ All tables
- ✅ All columns
- ✅ All indexes
- ✅ All functions/procedures
- ✅ All triggers
- ✅ All constraints
- ✅ Sample/test data (if any)

## ⚠️ Before You Migrate

### Quick Checklist:

- [ ] **Backup production** (Neon does this automatically, but double-check)
- [ ] **Test dev branch** - Make sure everything works
- [ ] **Document changes** - Know what's new
- [ ] **Plan rollback** - Know how to switch back
- [ ] **Notify users** (if needed) - Schedule maintenance window

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see Promote to Primary button"
- You might need admin/owner permissions
- Contact your Neon project admin

### "My app stopped working after promotion"
- Check your connection strings
- The endpoint names swap after promotion
- Update `.env.production` with new endpoint

### "I want to rollback"
- Go to Neon Console
- Your old production is now a branch
- Promote it back to primary
