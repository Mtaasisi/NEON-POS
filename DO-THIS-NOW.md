## 🚀 Step 2: Promote Branch in Neon Console

**⏱️ This takes 2 minutes**

### Go to Neon Console:

1. **Open**: https://console.neon.tech

2. **Select** your project

3. **Click** on "Branches" tab

4. **Find** your development branch:
   ```
   ep-dry-brook-ad3duuog
   ```

5. **Click** the branch to view details

6. **Look for** one of these buttons:
   - "Promote to Primary"
   - "Set as Primary"
   - "Make Primary"

7. **Click** the button

8. **Confirm** when prompted

9. **Wait** ~10-30 seconds for promotion to complete

10. **Done!** ✅

### What Just Happened?

- ✅ Your dev branch (`ep-dry-brook-ad3duuog`) is now the **main production branch**
- ✅ Your old production (`ep-damp-fire-adtxvumr`) is now a **backup branch**
- ✅ All schema changes from dev are now in production
- ✅ Automatic backup created
- ✅ Zero downtime

## 🔄 Step 3: Rebuild for Production

Now that your config is ready, rebuild:

```bash
# Rebuild with production database
npm run build:prod
```

This will create a production bundle using the promoted database.

```bash
# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

Open http://localhost:4173 and test:
- ✅ Login works

- ✅ All features work
- ✅ No console errors

## 🚀 Step 5: Deploy

Once tested, deploy your application:

### Option A: Automated Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Option B: Upload to Hosting
```bash
# Your production files are in dist/
# Upload this folder to:
# - Vercel
# - Netlify  
# - Your web server
# etc.
```
