# ✅ DATABASE CLEANUP COMPLETE

## Automatic Migration Successful! 🎉

The image upload feature has been **completely removed** from both the frontend and database.

### ✅ Database Changes Applied:

1. **product_images table** - ✅ DROPPED
2. **images column** from lats_products - ✅ REMOVED (with CASCADE)
3. **Image triggers** - ✅ REMOVED:
   - `update_product_images_updated_at`
   - `ensure_single_primary_image_trigger`
4. **Image functions** - ✅ REMOVED:
   - `update_product_images_updated_at()`
   - `ensure_single_primary_image()`
5. **Dependent views** - ✅ AUTOMATICALLY RECREATED without images column

### ✅ Frontend Changes Applied:

- **AddProductPage.tsx** - Image upload section removed
- **EditProductPage.tsx** - Image upload section removed
- All image validation and storage logic removed
- Zero linting errors ✅

### 🧪 What to Test Now:

1. ✅ Open Add Product page - should load without errors
2. ✅ Create a new product - should work without image section
3. ✅ Open Edit Product page - should load without errors  
4. ✅ Edit an existing product - should work without image section
5. ✅ Create products with variants - should work normally

### ⚠️ Optional Manual Cleanup:

If you're using **Supabase Storage**:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Find and delete the `product-images` bucket
3. This will free up storage space

### 📁 Files Created:

- `remove-image-tables-auto.mjs` - Automatic migration script (already executed)
- `REMOVE-IMAGE-UPLOAD-FEATURE.sql` - SQL migration file
- `IMAGE-REMOVAL-SUMMARY.md` - Complete documentation
