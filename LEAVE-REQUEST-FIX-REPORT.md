# 🎯 Leave Request Functionality - Fix Report

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Issue**: Request Leave button not working  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED & TESTED**

---

## 📋 Problem Summary

The "Request Leave" button on the Attendance page was visible but non-functional. Clicking the button did nothing because:
1. No `onClick` handler was attached to the button
2. No Leave Request Modal component existed
3. No UI flow for submitting leave requests

---

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. Added onClick Handler
**File**: `src/features/employees/components/EmployeeAttendanceCard.tsx`

Added state and click handler:
```typescript
const [showLeaveRequestModal, setShowLeaveRequestModal] = useState(false);

<GlassButton
  onClick={() => setShowLeaveRequestModal(true)}  // ← Added
>
  Request Leave
</GlassButton>
```

### 2. Created Leave Request Modal Component
**File**: `src/features/employees/components/LeaveRequestModal.tsx` (NEW)

Features:
- ✅ Professional modal UI with glass-morphism design
- ✅ 5 leave types: Annual, Sick, Personal, Emergency, Unpaid
- ✅ Date range picker (start & end date)
- ✅ Automatic duration calculation
- ✅ Reason text field with character count
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Success/error handling
- ✅ Integration with employeeService API

### 3. Integrated with Attendance Card
Added modal rendering and import:
```typescript
import LeaveRequestModal from './LeaveRequestModal';

{showLeaveRequestModal && (
  <LeaveRequestModal
    employeeId={employeeId}
    employeeName={employeeName}
    onClose={() => setShowLeaveRequestModal(false)}
    onSuccess={() => {
      setShowLeaveRequestModal(false);
      toast.success('Leave request submitted successfully');
    }}
  />
)}
```

### 4. Fixed Leave Type Enum
Updated leave types to match database schema:
- Changed from: `'vacation'` 
- Changed to: `'annual'`
- Now matches: `annual | sick | personal | emergency | unpaid`
