# ✅ SIMPLE FIX - No Unnecessary Columns

## What I Did

Since you're **not using dimensions/weight/barcode**, I fixed it the smart way:

### 1. ✅ Fixed the Code
Updated `variantUtils.ts` to **remove** the unused fields:
- ❌ Removed `barcode`
- ❌ Removed `weight` 
- ❌ Removed `dimensions`

Now the code only sends fields you actually use!

### 2. 🔧 Fix the Database (Run This)

You still need to rename one column in your database:
- `variant_name` → `name` (the code expects "name")

## 🚀 Quick Fix (1 Minute)

### Run this in your Neon SQL Editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE lats_product_variants RENAME COLUMN variant_name TO name;
```

**Or** run the file `FIX-VARIANT-NAME-ONLY.sql`

### Steps:
1. Go to https://console.neon.tech
2. Open SQL Editor
3. Paste the SQL above (or the contents of `FIX-VARIANT-NAME-ONLY.sql`)
4. Click "Run"
5. Done! ✅

## ✨ Result

After this fix:
- ✅ No unnecessary columns added
- ✅ Code doesn't try to insert fields you don't use
- ✅ Column names match what the code expects
- ✅ You can create products successfully!

## 🎯 Test It

1. Refresh your application
2. Try creating a product
3. It should work perfectly! 🎉
