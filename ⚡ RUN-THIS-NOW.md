# ⚡ RUN THIS NOW - Auto Fix Image Upload

## 🎯 Two Simple Commands

```sql
\i AUTO-FIX-IMAGE-UPLOAD.sql
```

Or copy/paste the entire contents of `AUTO-FIX-IMAGE-UPLOAD.sql`

**Expected output:**
```
✅ AUTOMATIC FIX COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
📊 Database Setup Summary:
   ✅ product_images table: READY
```

---

### Command 2: Create Storage Bucket (5 seconds)

In your terminal, run:

```bash
node auto-create-storage-bucket.mjs
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ BUCKET CREATION COMPLETE!
📋 Next Steps:
1. ✅ Database table is ready
2. ✅ Storage bucket is ready
3. 🎯 Test image upload in your app!
```

---

## 🎉 DONE! Now Test It

1. **Refresh your app**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
2. **Go to Add Product page**
3. **Try uploading an image**:
   - Click the upload area
   - Or drag & drop an image
   - Or press `Ctrl+V` to paste from clipboard
4. **Should see**: "Uploaded successfully!" ✅

## 🔧 Quick Troubleshooting

### If Command 2 Fails:

The script might say you need a **SERVICE ROLE KEY**. Here's how to get it:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to: **Settings → API**
4. Copy the **`service_role` key** (NOT the anon key)
5. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
   ```
6. Run command 2 again

**OR** create bucket manually (30 seconds):
1. Supabase Dashboard → **Storage**
2. Click **"Create bucket"**
3. Name: `product-images`
4. Check **"Public bucket"** ✅
5. Click **Create**

---

## ✅ How to Verify It Worked

Run this test:
```bash
node test-image-upload.mjs
```

Should show all ✅ checkmarks

## 📊 What Gets Fixed Automatically

### Database:
- ✅ Creates `product_images` table
- ✅ Adds 3 performance indexes
- ✅ Disables RLS (for Neon)
- ✅ Grants all permissions
- ✅ Sets up auto-update triggers
- ✅ Migrates any legacy images

### Storage:
- ✅ Creates `product-images` bucket
- ✅ Sets to Public
- ✅ Max size: 5MB per image
- ✅ Allowed types: JPG, PNG, WebP

---

## 🚨 Common Issues

### "Module not found" error
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### "Permission denied" in SQL
- Make sure you're logged in to Neon/Supabase
- Check you have admin access

### "Bucket creation failed"
- Add SERVICE ROLE key to `.env` (see above)
- Or create bucket manually

### Images still don't upload
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify bucket exists: Supabase Dashboard → Storage
3. Run diagnostic: `node test-image-upload.mjs`
