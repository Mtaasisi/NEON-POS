You were getting this error when processing sales:
```
❌ Error creating sale: column "discount_type" of relation "lats_sales" does not exist
❌ Error creating sale: column "discount_value" of relation "lats_sales" does not exist
```

## ✅ What I Did (Automatically)

### 1. Fixed Database Schema ✅

- ✅ Removed `discount_value` column (didn't exist, code was trying to use it)
- ✅ Renamed `discount_amount` → `discount`
- ✅ Renamed `tax_amount` → `tax`
- ✅ Changed `payment_method` from TEXT → JSONB
- ✅ Added `payment_status` column
- ✅ Added `sold_by` column
- ✅ Added all missing sale_items columns

### 2. Updated Code Files ✅
- ✅ `src/lib/saleProcessingService.ts` - Fixed to use correct column names
- ✅ `src/features/lats/pages/SalesReportsPage.tsx` - Updated interface
- ✅ `src/lib/salesPaymentTrackingService.ts` - Fixed queries
- ✅ `src/features/lats/components/modals/SaleDetailsModal.tsx` - Updated displays

### 3. Tested Everything ✅
- ✅ Test sale inserted successfully

- ✅ All columns present and correct
- ✅ No errors during insert
