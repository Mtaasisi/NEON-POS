## Troubleshooting

### Problem: All Graphs Empty
**Check:**
1. Database has payment data?
2. User is authenticated?
3. Console shows any errors?
4. Check browser network tab for failed API calls

**Solution:**
- Create test payment transactions
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify RLS policies allow reading payments

### Problem: Some Graphs Empty
**Check:**
1. Console logs for "Generated X" messages
2. Specific data availability (e.g., failed payments)

**Solution:**
- This is expected if no data for that category
- Empty states should show helpful messages

### Problem: Graphs Not Updating
**Check:**
1. Real-time subscription status in console
2. Auto-refresh toggle is ON
3. Network connectivity

**Solution:**
- Click refresh button manually
- Check Supabase realtime settings
- Verify subscription logs in console

### Problem: Performance Issues
**Check:**
1. Number of payment records
2. Browser memory usage
3. Network speed

**Solution:**
- Data is limited to last 500-1000 records per table
- Clear browser cache
- Reduce date range filters
