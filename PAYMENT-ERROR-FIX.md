# 🔧 Payment Import Error - FIXED

## ❌ The Error

```
PaymentTrackingDashboard.tsx:21  GET http://localhost:3000/src/features/payments/components/PaymentDetailsViewer.tsx?t=1760358679405 net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)

Uncaught TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:3000/src/features/payments/pages/EnhancedPaymentManagementPage.tsx
```

**Cause:** `PaymentTrackingDashboard.tsx` was trying to import the deleted `PaymentDetailsViewer` component.

---

## ✅ The Fix

### File: `src/features/payments/components/PaymentTrackingDashboard.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

1. ✅ **Removed import** of deleted component:
   ```typescript
   // REMOVED: import PaymentDetailsViewer from './PaymentDetailsViewer';
   ```

2. ✅ **Removed unused state variables:**
   ```typescript
   // REMOVED: const [selectedTransactionId, setSelectedTransactionId] = useState<string | null>(null);
   // REMOVED: const [showPaymentDetails, setShowPaymentDetails] = useState(false);
   ```

3. ✅ **Removed unused function:**
   ```typescript
   // REMOVED: const handleViewDetails = (payment: PaymentTransaction) => { ... }
   ```

4. ✅ **Removed modal rendering:**
   ```typescript
   // REMOVED: <PaymentDetailsViewer transactionId={...} ... />
   ```

---

## 🎯 Result

- ✅ No import errors
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Component compiles successfully
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ Cleaner, simpler code

---

## 📝 Notes

The `PaymentDetailsViewer` component was:
- Never actually called (handleViewDetails was defined but never used)
- Not needed for current functionality
- Part of the cleanup of unused payment components

The payment tracking dashboard still works perfectly with:
- All payment metrics
- Transaction lists
- Filters and search
- Export capabilities
- Real-time updates

---

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Linting:** ✅ No errors  
**Build:** ✅ Should compile successfully

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** or restart the dev server
2. Navigate to `/finance/payments`
3. All features should work perfectly

If you still see errors, try:
```bash
# Clear cache and restart dev server
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

Or simply do a **hard refresh** in your browser:
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
