# 🎯 Fix Purchase Order Payment Processing Error

## Problem
When trying to make a payment on a purchase order, you're getting:
```
function process_purchase_order_payment(...) does not exist
```

## Solution
Run the SQL file to create the payment processing function.

## Steps

### 1️⃣ Open Neon Database SQL Editor
- Go to your Neon Database dashboard
- Open the SQL Editor

### 2️⃣ Run This File
Copy and paste the contents of:
```
CREATE-PURCHASE-ORDER-PAYMENT-FUNCTION.sql
```

### 3️⃣ Verify
After running, you should see:
- ✅ Purchase order payment function created successfully!
- ✅ You can now process payments for purchase orders.

### 4️⃣ Test
1. Go to your Purchase Order Detail page
2. Click "Make Payment"
3. Select payment method (e.g., Cash)
4. Enter payment amount
5. Complete the payment
6. Should work without the 400 error!

## What This Does
The function handles the complete payment workflow:
- 💰 Creates payment record in `purchase_order_payments`
- 📊 Updates purchase order payment status (unpaid → partial → paid)
- 💳 Creates finance transaction record
- 📈 Updates payment account balance
- 📝 Logs audit trail automatically

## Payment Status Logic
- **Unpaid**: No payments made yet
- **Partial**: Some payment made, but less than total
- **Paid**: Full amount paid or exceeded

## Expected Result
After running this:
- ✅ Payment modal will work properly
- ✅ Payments are tracked in the database
- ✅ Finance accounts are updated
- ✅ Payment status updates automatically
- ✅ No more 400 errors!

**Note**: This function works with the `log_purchase_order_audit` function you created earlier to maintain a complete audit trail! 🔗
