## ⚠️ Potential Issues to Check

### **Issue 1: Payment Method Configuration**
**Check:** Are payment methods configured in finance_accounts table?

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM finance_accounts WHERE is_payment_method = TRUE;
```

**Fix if empty:** Need to create payment method accounts

---

### **Issue 2: Missing RPC Function**
**Check:** Does `process_purchase_order_payment()` exist?

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'process_purchase_order_payment';
```

**Fix if missing:** Need to create the function

---

### **Issue 3: Payment Reference Validation**
**Check:** M-Pesa reference format validation

**Expected formats:**
- M-Pesa: `QKJ1234567` (10-12 characters, starts with letters)
- Bank: Any alphanumeric reference

---

## 🔍 Quick Diagnostic

Run this SQL to check payment system setup:

```sql
-- 1. Check payment methods
SELECT 
  id, 
  name, 
  account_type, 
  currency, 
  balance,
  is_payment_method,
  is_active
FROM finance_accounts
WHERE is_payment_method = TRUE
ORDER BY name;

-- 2. Check recent sales with payments
SELECT 
  s.id,
  s.sale_number,
  s.total_amount,
  s.payment_method,
  s.payment_status,
  s.created_at
FROM lats_sales s
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Check for purchase order payments
SELECT 
  pop.id,
  pop.amount,
  pop.currency,
  pop.payment_method,
  pop.status,
  pop.payment_date,
  po.po_number
FROM purchase_order_payments pop
