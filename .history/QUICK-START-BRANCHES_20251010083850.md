## 🔧 Manual Configuration

If you need to manually configure, edit `.env`:

```env
# For Development:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_vABqUKk73tEW@ep-damp-fire-adtxvumr-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

# For Production:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_vABqUKk73tEW@ep-damp-fire-adtxvumr-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never commit `.env`** - It's automatically ignored by git
2. **Always test on development first** before pushing to production
3. **Database changes** - Test schema changes on development branch
4. **Current Status** - You're now using the **development** branch by default
