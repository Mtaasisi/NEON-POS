### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues

Only 2 errors occurred (both non-critical):
- "Mobile Phones" category already existed (duplicate key)
- "Accessories" category already existed (duplicate key)

These categories were preserved from your existing database.

### üìù Note About Prices

Some products show 0 TZS price because:
- The backup stored prices in the `variants` table, not the main products table
- Your current schema uses `unit_price` at the product level
- Variant prices were imported successfully

To see full pricing, check the product variants or you may need to update product-level prices.

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Verify Products**: Check your POS system to see the imported products
2. **Update Prices**: If needed, update any missing unit prices
3. **Review Categories**: Ensure products are in correct categories
4. **Test Inventory**: Create test transactions to verify everything works

### üìÇ Import Scripts Created

- `import-products-from-backup-fixed.mjs` - The working import script
- `check-current-schema.mjs` - Schema verification tool
- `verify-import.mjs` - Import verification tool

You can re-run these scripts anytime if you need to import from other backups.

### üí° Usage

To import from another backup in the future:

1. Update the backup file path in `import-products-from-backup-fixed.mjs`
2. Run: `node import-products-from-backup-fixed.mjs`
3. Verify: `node verify-import.mjs`

### üñºÔ∏è  Product Images

- **Created**: 42 images successfully imported
- **Skipped**: 26 images (linked to non-existent products)
- Images are stored as **base64 data URLs** in the `image_url` field
- Includes thumbnail URLs for faster loading
- Sample images: Soundbars, iPhones, MacBooks, keyboards, and more

**Note**: The 26 skipped images were linked to products that don't exist in your current database. All images for your imported products have been successfully added!
