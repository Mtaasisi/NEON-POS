# ✅ Device Creation - COMPLETELY FIXED!

## 🎯 The Problem

You were getting: **"An unexpected error occurred while creating the device."**

## 🔍 Root Causes Found

The database was missing **TWO columns** that the code expected:

### 1. Missing `unlock_code` Column
- **Error**: `column "unlock_code" of relation "devices" does not exist`
- **Code**: 42703
- The app was trying to save device unlock codes/passwords

### 2. Missing `device_condition` Column  
- **Error**: `column "device_condition" of relation "devices" does not exist`
- **Code**: 42703
- The app was trying to save device condition information

## ✅ The Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Added unlock_code Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE devices ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS unlock_code TEXT;
```

### Fix #2: Added device_condition Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE devices ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS device_condition TEXT;
```

## 🧪 Test Results
