## ⚠️ Minor Issues Found (Easy Fixes)

### 3 Small Database Issues:

1. **Missing table: `daily_sales_closures`**
   - Impact: POS day-end closing feature can't work
   - Fix: Already have SQL file `CREATE-DAILY-SALES-CLOSURES-TABLE.sql`
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Dashboard using wrong table name**
   - Using: `payments` (doesn't exist)
   - Should use: `customer_payments` (exists and working)
   - Fix: Update frontend code
   - Priority: Low (doesn't break anything)

3. **Missing columns:**
   - `devices.expected_completion_date` - for device tracking
   - `appointments.appointment_time` - for appointment sorting
   - Fix: Run `🔧 QUICK-FIX-TEST-ISSUES.sql` (I created it for you)
   - Priority: Low
