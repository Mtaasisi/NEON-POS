## 🛠️ Customization

### Change Test Data
Edit `auto-test-product-creation.mjs`:

```javascript
const TEST_PRODUCTS = [
  {
    name: `Your Product Name ${Date.now()}`,
    category: 'electronics',  // Change category
    condition: 'new',         // new/used/refurbished
    description: 'Your description',
    price: 99.99,            // Change price
    costPrice: 50.00,        // Change cost

    minStockLevel: 5
  }
];
```

### Slow Down the Test
```javascript
const SLOW_MO = 1000; // Change from 300 to 1000
```

### Run Headless (No Browser Window)
```javascript
headless: true, // Change from false to true
```
