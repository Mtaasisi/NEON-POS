## 🎯 How to Create More Products

### Option 1: Use the Direct Script (Fastest)

```bash
node create-product-direct.mjs
```

**To customize products:**
1. Open `create-product-direct.mjs`
2. Find the `SAMPLE_PRODUCTS` array (around line 12)
3. Edit or add products:

```javascript
const SAMPLE_PRODUCTS = [
  {
    name: `Your Product Name ${Date.now()}`,
    description: 'Your product description',
    category: 'Your Category',  // Category will be created if doesn't exist
    condition: 'new',           // not used in current schema
    costPrice: 100.00,          // Your cost
    sellingPrice: 199.99,       // Your selling price
    quantity: 50,               // Initial stock
    minQuantity: 5,             // Minimum stock level
    sku: `YOUR-${Date.now()}`   // Auto-generated unique SKU
  }
  // Add more products here...
];
```

4. Run the script:
```bash
node create-product-direct.mjs
```

### Option 2: Use the UI (Visual)

The automated UI test works but has some database schema issues. The direct script is more reliable.

**To run UI test anyway:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 (wait 5 seconds for dev server)
npm run test:product
```

This will:
- Open a browser
- Login automatically
- Fill out the product form
- Take screenshots
- Submit the form

Check `test-screenshots-product-creation/` folder for screenshots.

## 🔧 Database Schema Reference

The `lats_products` table has these fields:

```
✅ name              - Product name (required)
✅ description       - Product description
✅ sku              - Stock keeping unit (auto-generated)
✅ category_id      - Category UUID (auto-created from category name)
✅ unit_price       - Selling price
✅ cost_price       - Cost price
✅ stock_quantity   - Initial stock
✅ min_stock_level  - Minimum stock alert level
✅ is_active        - Active status (default true)
✅ barcode          - Product barcode (optional)
✅ supplier_id      - Supplier UUID (optional)

## 💡 Tips

### 1. Auto-Generate Unique SKUs
Use `${Date.now()}` in your SKU:
```javascript
sku: `PROD-${Date.now()}`
```

### 2. Auto-Create Categories
Just provide a category name - if it doesn't exist, it will be created:
```javascript
category: 'New Category Name'
```

### 3. Bulk Import from CSV/Excel

Want to import many products at once? The direct script can be modified to read from a CSV file. Let me know if you need this!

### 4. Add Images Later

Products can be created without images. You can add images later through:
- The edit product page
- The `product_images` table
- Bulk image upload scripts

## 📊 Quick Commands

```bash
# Create 3 sample products
node create-product-direct.mjs

# Check latest products in database
node -e "
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
const dbConfig = JSON.parse(readFileSync('./database-config.json', 'utf-8'));
const sql = neon(dbConfig.url);
const products = await sql\`SELECT name, sku, unit_price, stock_quantity FROM lats_products ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10\`;
console.table(products);
"

# Run visual UI test (with screenshots)
npm run test:product
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Column does not exist" error
The direct script is already updated to use the correct schema. If you see this, make sure you're running the latest version.

### Products not showing in UI
- Check that `is_active = true`
- Verify the category exists
- Check browser console for errors

### Duplicate SKU error
Make sure each product has a unique SKU. Use `${Date.now()}` to auto-generate unique values.
