# üöÄ Quick Fix: Product Deletion Failed

## Problem
Products cannot be deleted due to foreign key constraints.

## Solution (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Run the Fix Script

1. **Open Neon Database SQL Editor**
   - Go to your Neon dashboard
   - Select your database
   - Click "SQL Editor"

2. **Copy and Run the Fix**
   ```bash
   # Copy the contents of fix-product-deletion.sql
   # Paste into Neon SQL Editor
   # Click "Run"
   ```

3. **Expected Output**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Dropped old lats_stock_movements_product_id_fkey constraint
   ‚úÖ Added lats_stock_movements_product_id_fkey with ON DELETE SET NULL
   ‚úÖ Dropped old lats_purchase_order_items_product_id_fkey constraint
   ‚úÖ Added lats_purchase_order_items_product_id_fkey with ON DELETE SET NULL
   ‚úÖ Dropped old lats_sale_items_product_id_fkey constraint
   ‚úÖ Added lats_sale_items_product_id_fkey with ON DELETE SET NULL
   ‚úÖ Product deletion constraints fixed!
   ```

### Step 2: Test Product Deletion

1. **Go to your POS application**
2. **Navigate to Products/Inventory**
3. **Select a product**
4. **Click Delete**
5. **Confirm deletion**
6. ‚úÖ **Product should be deleted successfully!**

## What Was Fixed

| Table | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `lats_stock_movements` | ‚ùå Blocks deletion | ‚úÖ Sets product_id to NULL |
| `lats_purchase_order_items` | ‚ùå Blocks deletion | ‚úÖ Sets product_id to NULL |
| `lats_sale_items` | ‚ùå Blocks deletion | ‚úÖ Sets product_id to NULL |

## What Happens When You Delete a Product

### ‚úÖ Product is Deleted
- Removed from `lats_products` table
- Variants are deleted (cascade)
- Images are deleted (cascade)

### ‚úÖ History is Preserved
- Sales records remain (product_id becomes NULL)
- Purchase orders remain (product_id becomes NULL)
- Stock movements remain (product_id becomes NULL)
- Product names in `lats_sale_items` are preserved

### ‚úÖ Reports Still Work
- Sales reports show product name even if product is deleted
- Historical data is intact
- Financial records are accurate

## Troubleshooting

### Still Can't Delete?

1. **Run the diagnostic script first**
   ```sql
   -- In Neon SQL Editor
   \i diagnose-product-deletion.sql
   ```

2. **Check the output for other blocking constraints**

3. **If you see different constraint names**, update the fix script with the actual names

### Error: "Constraint does not exist"

This means your database might already have the correct constraints! Try deleting a product again.

### Permission Denied

Make sure you're logged in as:
- Database owner, OR
- User with `ALTER TABLE` privileges
