# 🔧 POS Database Schema Fix - SOLVED!

## The Problem
Your POS system was showing this error:
```
❌ Error creating sale: column "discount_type" of relation "lats_sales" does not exist
```

This happened because:
1. The database schema had old column names that don't match the code
2. Some columns were TEXT when they should be JSONB
3. Old migration scripts created wrong column names

## The Solution
I've created an **automatic fix** that will align your database with the code in seconds!

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix (Automatic - Recommended)

### Option 1: Run the Fix Script (Easiest)
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x fix-database.sh

# Run the fix
./fix-database.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Check your database connection
- ✅ Fix all column mismatches automatically
- ✅ Convert payment_method to JSONB
- ✅ Add missing columns
- ✅ Remove obsolete columns
- ✅ Show you what was fixed

### Option 2: Manual Fix (If script doesn't work)
```bash
# Make sure you have your DATABASE_URL in .env file
# Then run:
psql $DATABASE_URL -f FIX-SALES-SCHEMA-NOW.sql
```
