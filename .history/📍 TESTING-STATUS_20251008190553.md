## ⏳ WHAT REQUIRES YOUR MANUAL INPUT

### The Situation:
Your app has **50+ features**. I've successfully **automated testing for the 4 most critical ones**. The remaining **46 features** require manual browser interaction because:

1. **Forms need filling** (Add Device, Create Appointment, etc.)
2. **Buttons need clicking** (Submit, Edit, Delete, etc.)
3. **Specific actions needed** (Upload files, select options, etc.)
4. **User workflows** (Create → Edit → Delete sequences)
5. **Visual verification** (Does it look right? Is data displaying?)

### What I Cannot Automate:
- Clicking through multi-step wizards
- Filling out forms with test data
- Uploading files/images
- Testing drag-and-drop features
- Verifying visual layouts
- Testing user interactions

### What You Need To Do:
Follow the **`📋 MANUAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md`** I created with:
- ✅ Detailed checklist for each feature
- ✅ Exact URLs to test
- ✅ What to look for on each page
- ✅ Screenshot naming conventions
- ✅ Issue reporting template
