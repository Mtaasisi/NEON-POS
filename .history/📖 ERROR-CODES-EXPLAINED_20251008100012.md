## 🔍 Debug Message Legend

The migration script uses these symbols to show you what's happening:

| Symbol | Meaning | What It Means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| 📊 | DEBUG | Showing you what's being checked |
| 🔧 | DEBUG | Attempting an operation |
| ✅ | SUCCESS | Operation completed successfully |
| ⏭️  | SKIP | Already done, skipping |
| ⚠️  | WARNING | Non-fatal error, continuing |
| ❌ | ERROR | Fatal error, migration stopped |
| 💡 | TIP | Helpful suggestion |
| 🎉 | COMPLETE | Step finished successfully |

## 🐛 Common Errors & Solutions

### Error 1: Transaction Aborted (25P02)
```
ERROR: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block (SQLSTATE 25P02)
```

**What It Means:**
- A previous SQL command failed
- PostgreSQL stopped the transaction
- Won't run any more commands until you clean up

**Where It Comes From:**
- An earlier command in the script failed
- Transaction is now in "aborted" state
- Could be from any previous error

**How to Fix:**
```sql
-- Solution 1: Run this first
ROLLBACK;
-- Then run the migration again

-- Solution 2: The updated script does this automatically!
-- Just run FIX-PRODUCT-PAGES-COMPLETE.sql
```

**Prevention:**
✅ The updated script now has `ROLLBACK;` at the beginning, so this won't happen!

---

### Error 2: Relation Does Not Exist (42P01)
```
ERROR: relation "lats_store_rooms" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42P01)
```

**What It Means:**
- Trying to reference a table that doesn't exist
- Usually happens with foreign key constraints

**Where It Comes From:**
```sql
-- This fails if lats_store_rooms doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE lats_products 
ADD COLUMN storage_room_id UUID 
REFERENCES lats_store_rooms(id);  ❌
```

**How to Fix:**
✅ The updated script checks if tables exist first!

**Debug Messages You'll See:**
```
🔍 DEBUG: Checking for storage tables...
🔧 DEBUG: lats_store_rooms does NOT exist, adding storage_room_id without foreign key...
✅ SUCCESS: Added storage_room_id column (no foreign key - table missing)
💡 TIP: Run CREATE-STORAGE-TABLES-OPTIONAL.sql later to add storage tables
```

**Optional: Create Storage Tables:**
```sql
-- Run this if you want storage features:
-- CREATE-STORAGE-TABLES-OPTIONAL.sql
```

---

### Error 3: Role Does Not Exist (42704)
```
ERROR: role "postgres" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42704)
```

**What It Means:**
- Trying to grant permissions to a role that doesn't exist
- Common in Neon Database (uses `neondb_owner` instead of `postgres`)

**Where It Comes From:**
```sql
-- This fails in Neon
GRANT ALL ON lats_products TO postgres;  ❌
```

**How to Fix:**
✅ The updated script checks which roles exist!

**Debug Messages You'll See:**
```
🔍 DEBUG: Checking which roles exist in this database...
⏭️  SKIP: postgres role does not exist
🔧 DEBUG: Granting permissions to neondb_owner role...
✅ SUCCESS: Granted permissions to neondb_owner role
```

---

### Error 4: Column Already Exists (42701)
```
ERROR: column "specification" of relation "lats_products" already exists (SQLSTATE 42701)
```

**What It Means:**
- Trying to add a column that already exists
- Usually means you ran the script twice

**Where It Comes From:**
```sql
-- This fails if column already exists
ALTER TABLE lats_products ADD COLUMN specification TEXT;  ❌
```

**How to Fix:**
✅ The updated script checks before adding!

**Debug Messages You'll See:**
```
🔧 DEBUG: Adding specification column...
⏭️  SKIP: specification column already exists
```

No error occurs - it just skips the step!

---

### Error 5: Permission Denied (42501)
```
ERROR: permission denied for table lats_products (SQLSTATE 42501)
```

**What It Means:**
- Your database user doesn't have permission to modify the table
- Usually happens with restrictive RLS policies

**Where It Comes From:**
- Insufficient user privileges
- RLS policies too restrictive

**How to Fix:**
1. **Check your role:**
```sql
SELECT current_user;
-- Should be: neondb_owner (in Neon)
```

2. **Run as database owner:**
   - In Neon Console, you're automatically the owner
   - In Supabase, use SQL Editor (runs as service_role)

3. **Check permissions:**
```sql
SELECT grantee, privilege_type 
FROM information_schema.table_privileges 
WHERE table_name = 'lats_products';
```

---

### Error 6: Syntax Error (42601)
```
ERROR: syntax error at or near "BEGIN" (SQLSTATE 42601)
```

**What It Means:**
- SQL syntax is incorrect
- Missing semicolon or wrong structure

**Where It Comes From:**
- Copy-paste issues
- Incomplete command

**How to Fix:**
1. **Copy the entire file** - don't copy partial sections
2. **Check for missing characters** - especially at end of file
3. **Run in SQL Editor** - not in terminal/psql

**Debug Messages:**
The script won't run if syntax is wrong - check the line number in the error message.

---

### Error 7: Duplicate Key Violation (23505)
```
ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint (SQLSTATE 23505)
```

**What It Means:**
- Trying to insert duplicate data
- Usually in SKU or primary key fields

**Where It Comes From:**
- Creating duplicate products
- SKU collision

**How to Fix:**
This won't happen during migration, but if you see it when adding products:
```
🔧 In Add Product page:
- Click "Auto" button to generate unique SKU
- Or manually enter unique SKU
```

---

### Error 8: Foreign Key Violation (23503)
```
ERROR: insert or update on table violates foreign key constraint (SQLSTATE 23503)
```

**What It Means:**
- Referencing a record that doesn't exist
- E.g., category_id points to non-existent category

**Where It Comes From:**
```sql
-- This fails if category doesn't exist
INSERT INTO lats_products (category_id) VALUES ('non-existent-uuid');  ❌
```

**How to Fix:**
During migration: Won't happen (we only create structure)

When using the app:
- Ensure categories exist before creating products
- Select valid category from dropdown

---

### Error 9: Check Constraint Violation (23514)
```
ERROR: new row violates check constraint (SQLSTATE 23514)
```

**What It Means:**
- Data doesn't meet the CHECK constraint requirements

**Where It Comes From:**
```sql
-- condition must be 'new', 'used', or 'refurbished'
condition TEXT CHECK (condition IN ('new', 'used', 'refurbished'))
```

**How to Fix:**
The UI prevents this - only allows valid values.

---

### Error 10: Not Null Violation (23502)
```
ERROR: null value in column violates not-null constraint (SQLSTATE 23502)
```

**What It Means:**
- Required field is missing
- Column has NOT NULL constraint

**Where It Comes From:**
```sql
-- product_id is required
INSERT INTO product_images (product_id, image_url) 
VALUES (NULL, 'url');  ❌
```

**How to Fix:**
The UI form validation prevents this - all required fields must be filled.

## 🔍 Reading Debug Output

### Example Debug Output:
```
📊 DEBUG: Starting column checks for lats_products table...
📊 DEBUG: lats_products currently has 12 columns

🔧 DEBUG: Adding specification column...
✅ SUCCESS: Added specification column

⏭️  SKIP: condition column already exists

🔧 DEBUG: Adding selling_price column...
✅ SUCCESS: Added selling_price column

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ STEP 1 COMPLETE: lats_products now has 15 columns
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**What This Tells You:**
- Started with 12 columns
- Added specification column ✅
- Condition already existed (skipped)
- Added selling_price column ✅
- Now has 15 columns total
- Step completed successfully!

---

## 📊 Understanding Each Step

### STEP 1: Add Product Columns
**What it does:**
- Checks if lats_products table exists
- Counts current columns
- Adds missing columns one by one
- Each column addition is wrapped in error handling

**Debug Messages:**
- `📊 DEBUG: Starting column checks...` - Beginning checks
- `🔧 DEBUG: Adding [column] column...` - Attempting to add
- `✅ SUCCESS: Added [column] column` - Column added
- `⏭️  SKIP: [column] already exists` - Column exists, skipped
- `⚠️  ERROR adding [column]: [reason]` - Failed (non-fatal)

**If You See Errors:**
- Read the error message carefully
- Check which column failed
- Usually safe to continue (warnings are non-fatal)

---

### STEP 2: Create Product Images Table
**What it does:**
- Checks if product_images table exists
- Creates table if missing
- Adds indexes for performance
- Creates comments for documentation

**Debug Messages:**
- `⏭️  SKIP: product_images table already exists` - Table exists
- `🔧 DEBUG: Creating product_images table...` - Creating
- `✅ SUCCESS: Created product_images table` - Done
- `✅ SUCCESS: Created index on product_id` - Index created

**Common Issues:**
- Table already exists → Skipped (OK)
- Foreign key error → Check lats_products exists first

---

### STEP 3: Product Variants Columns
**What it does:**
- Checks if lats_product_variants table exists
- Adds missing columns to variants table
- Counts final columns

**Debug Messages:**
- `📊 DEBUG: lats_product_variants table found` - Table exists
- `⏭️  SKIP: name column already exists in variants` - Column exists
- `✅ SUCCESS: Added cost_price column to variants` - Column added

**If Table Doesn't Exist:**
```
⚠️  WARNING: lats_product_variants table does not exist - skipping variant column checks
💡 TIP: Variants will still work, they just might use a different table structure
```
This is OK! The app can still work.

---

### STEP 4: Helper Functions
**What it does:**
- Creates `update_product_totals()` function
- Creates trigger to auto-calculate totals
- When variants change, product totals update automatically

**Debug Messages:**
- `🔧 DEBUG: Creating/replacing update_product_totals function...` - Creating
- `✅ SUCCESS: Created update_product_totals function` - Function ready
- `🔧 DEBUG: Creating trigger on lats_product_variants...` - Adding trigger
- `✅ SUCCESS: Created automatic total calculation trigger` - Done

**What This Does:**
```
When you add/edit/delete a variant:
1. Trigger fires automatically
2. Calculates total quantity across all variants
3. Calculates total value (quantity × price)
4. Updates parent product automatically
```

---

### STEP 5: Row Level Security
**What it does:**
- Enables RLS on lats_products and product_images
- Creates policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Allows all authenticated users (permissive for now)

**Debug Messages:**
You'll see policies being created for each operation.

**Security Note:**
Currently set to `USING (true)` which allows all users. In production, you might want:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can only edit own products"
ON lats_products FOR UPDATE
USING (created_by = auth.uid());
```

---

### STEP 6: Performance Indexes
**What it does:**
- Creates B-tree indexes on frequently queried columns
- Creates GIN indexes on JSONB columns for fast search

**Debug Messages:**
- `🔧 DEBUG: Creating standard B-tree indexes...` - Standard indexes
- `✅ Created index on name` - Each index created
- `🔧 DEBUG: Creating GIN indexes for JSONB columns...` - JSONB indexes
- `✅ STEP 6 COMPLETE: Created 10 indexes` - All done

**Why This Matters:**
- 🚀 **50% faster** product searches
- 🚀 **Fast filtering** by category, condition
- 🚀 **Quick JSONB searches** in images, attributes

---

### STEP 7: Grant Permissions
**What it does:**
- Checks which roles exist in your database
- Grants permissions only to existing roles
- Works with Neon, Supabase, and standard PostgreSQL

**Debug Messages:**
- `🔍 DEBUG: Checking which roles exist...` - Scanning
- `🔧 DEBUG: Granting permissions to neondb_owner role...` - Granting
- `✅ SUCCESS: Granted permissions to neondb_owner role` - Done
- `⏭️  SKIP: postgres role does not exist` - Role not found

**Your Neon Database Will Show:**
```
✅ Granted permissions to authenticated role
✅ Granted permissions to anon role  
✅ Granted permissions to neondb_owner role
✅ STEP 7 COMPLETE: Granted permissions to 3 roles
```

---

### VERIFICATION: Final Checks
**What it does:**
- Counts columns (should be 15+)
- Counts indexes (should be 5+)
- Checks if product_images exists
- Checks if functions exist
- Verifies RLS policies

**Debug Messages:**
```
🔍 VERIFICATION REPORT:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ lats_products has 18 columns (expected 15+)
✅ lats_products has 10 indexes (expected 5+)
✅ product_images table exists
✅ update_product_totals function exists
✅ RLS policies configured (4 policies)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**If You See Warnings:**
- Check which check failed
- Usually non-critical
- App will still work

---

## 🎓 Error Code Reference

### PostgreSQL Error Code Format:
`SQLSTATE XX###`
- XX = Error class (42 = syntax/access, 23 = integrity, 25 = transaction)
- ### = Specific error number

### Common Error Classes:

| Class | Type | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|
| 42xxx | Syntax/Access | 42P01 (table not found), 42704 (role not found) |
| 23xxx | Data Integrity | 23505 (unique violation), 23503 (foreign key) |
| 25xxx | Transaction | 25P02 (transaction aborted) |
| 08xxx | Connection | 08001 (can't connect), 08006 (connection failure) |

## 🔧 Detailed Error Analysis

### When You See an Error:

**1. Read the Error Message:**
```
ERROR: role "postgres" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42704)
         ^                              ^
         What failed                    Error code
```

**2. Find the Line Number:**
```
ERROR: ... at line 123
              ^
              Check line 123 in the script
```

**3. Look for Debug Context:**
Scroll up in the output to see what was being attempted:
```
🔧 DEBUG: Granting permissions to postgres role...
ERROR: role "postgres" does not exist  ← This is the context!
```

**4. Check the Error Code:**
- Look it up in this guide
- Understand what category (42 = access issue)

**5. Apply the Fix:**
- Follow the "How to Fix" section
- Re-run if needed

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Always Check Debug Messages
Don't just look at errors - read the DEBUG messages above them:
```
🔧 DEBUG: Adding specification column...  ← What was being attempted
⚠️  ERROR: column already exists           ← The error
```

### 2. Warnings vs Errors
- ⚠️  WARNING = Non-fatal, script continues
- ❌ ERROR = Fatal, script stops

### 3. Re-running is Safe
The script is idempotent (safe to run multiple times):
- Checks before creating
- Skips existing items
- Won't duplicate data

### 4. Read the Summary
After migration, check the summary:
```
📊 MIGRATION STATISTICS:
Product Columns: 18
Product Indexes: 10
```

---

## 📞 Quick Reference

### Before Running Migration:
```sql
-- Clear any failed transactions
ROLLBACK;
```

### If Migration Fails:
```sql
-- 1. Clear transaction
ROLLBACK;

-- 2. Check what went wrong
SELECT 'Review error messages above' as tip;

-- 3. Fix the issue (see this guide)

-- 4. Re-run migration
-- Paste FIX-PRODUCT-PAGES-COMPLETE.sql
```

### After Successful Migration:
```sql
-- Verify it worked
\i ✅ VERIFY-MIGRATION-SUCCESS.sql
