# üöÄ Fix Customer Search and Appointments Errors

## Problem
You're seeing these errors in the console:
1. ‚ùå **Fast search error** - Customer search is failing
2. ‚ùå **Appointments error** - Cannot fetch appointments

## Root Cause
The `appointments` table schema doesn't match what the frontend code expects:
- Missing `service_type` column (has `appointment_type` instead)
- Missing `appointment_time` column (only has `appointment_date` as timestamp)
- Missing `customer_name`, `customer_phone`, `technician_name` columns
- RLS policies might be too restrictive

## Solution - Run This SQL Script

### Step 1: Run the Fix Script
Execute the `FIX-APPOINTMENTS-SCHEMA.sql` file in your Neon database console:

1. Go to your Neon Console: https://console.neon.tech
2. Select your database
3. Click on **SQL Editor**
4. Copy and paste the contents of `FIX-APPOINTMENTS-SCHEMA.sql`
5. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
After running the script, you should see these success messages:
```
‚úÖ Added service_type column
‚úÖ Added appointment_time column
‚úÖ Added customer_name column
‚úÖ Added customer_phone column
‚úÖ Added technician_name column
‚úÖ Appointments and customers tables fixed successfully!
```

### Step 3: Refresh Your App
1. Go back to your browser
2. Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+F5 on Windows)
3. Try searching for customers again
4. Check if appointments load correctly

## What This Fix Does

### Appointments Table
- ‚úÖ Adds `service_type` column (frontend uses this instead of `appointment_type`)
- ‚úÖ Adds `appointment_time` column (frontend expects separate date and time fields)
- ‚úÖ Adds `customer_name` and `customer_phone` columns (denormalized for performance)
- ‚úÖ Adds `technician_name` column
- ‚úÖ Populates these fields from existing customer data
- ‚úÖ Updates RLS policies to allow read/write access

### Customers Table
- ‚úÖ Updates RLS policies to allow authenticated users full access
- ‚úÖ Allows anonymous users read-only access

## Expected Results
After the fix:
- ‚úÖ Customer search should work without errors
- ‚úÖ Appointments should load successfully  
- ‚úÖ No more 400 errors in the console
- ‚úÖ Faster queries due to denormalized data

## Still Having Issues?
If you still see errors after running this script:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Make sure you're logged in to the app
3. Check your Neon database connection string in the `.env` file
4. Share the exact error message with me
