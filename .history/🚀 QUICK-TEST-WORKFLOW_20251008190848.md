## ⚡ Speed Testing Tips

### For Each Feature (5-8 min):

**Minute 1-2:** Load & Observe
- Open URL
- See if page loads
- Check for obvious errors

**Minute 3-5:** Quick Interaction
- Click "New/Add" button
- Try to create one item
- Test one filter/search

**Minute 6-7:** Screenshot & Document
- Take 1-2 screenshots
- Note if working/broken
- Write quick summary

**Minute 8:** Move On
- Mark as tested
- Say "next" to continue

### Don't Test Everything!
- ✅ Just verify it WORKS
- ✅ Main features functional
- ❌ Don't test every button
- ❌ Don't create lots of test data
- ❌ Don't debug issues now

A feature is "working" if:
- ✅ Page loads (no 404/500 errors)
- ✅ Main content displays
- ✅ Can perform basic action (add/create/view)
- ✅ No critical JavaScript errors

Don't worry about:
- ⚠️ Missing data (normal for new system)
- ⚠️ Minor styling issues
- ⚠️ Optional features not working
- ⚠️ Advanced functionality
