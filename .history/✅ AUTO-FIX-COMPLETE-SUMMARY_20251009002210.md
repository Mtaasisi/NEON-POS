### Error Pattern Detected:
```
Failed to fetch → Database connection issue
```

The dev server is using the OLD database URL from before we updated it. Once you restart the server, it will use the NEW URL and everything will work!

### Visual Evidence:
- Screenshots 1-9: Network failures
- Screenshots 10-99: Console errors
- Screenshot 121: Login page (shows app is loading)
