# üéØ Fix Purchase Order Audit Function Error

## Problem
When updating purchase order status, you're getting this error:
```
function log_purchase_order_audit(unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown) does not exist
```

## Solution
Run the SQL file to create the missing function.

## Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Neon Database SQL Editor
- Go to your Neon Database dashboard
- Open the SQL Editor

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run This File
Copy and paste the contents of:
```
CREATE-PURCHASE-ORDER-AUDIT-FUNCTION.sql
```

Or run it directly if you have a CLI connection.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify
After running, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Purchase order audit function created successfully!
- ‚úÖ You can now update purchase order statuses without errors.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test
1. Go back to your PurchaseOrderDetailPage
2. Try updating the order status (e.g., Confirm Order)
3. The action should work without the 400 error

## What This Does
- Creates the `purchase_order_audit` table (if it doesn't exist)
- Creates the `log_purchase_order_audit()` function
- Sets up proper indexes for performance
- Grants necessary permissions

## Expected Result
After running this:
- ‚úÖ Order status updates will work
- ‚úÖ Audit trail will be logged properly
- ‚úÖ No more 400 errors when confirming/updating orders

**Quick Tip**: The function is set to `SECURITY DEFINER` so it runs with elevated privileges to ensure audit entries are always logged, even if direct table access is restricted.
