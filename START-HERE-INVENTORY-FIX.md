# üîß FIX: Products Not Showing in Inventory

## Your Issue

You received products via purchase orders, but:
- ‚úÖ Totals show items were received
- ‚ùå Inventory shows 0 stock  
- ‚ùå Cannot sell the items

## Root Cause

The `inventory_items` table has your products, but the `lats_product_variants.quantity` field (used by the UI) wasn't updated.

## üöÄ QUICK FIX (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run the Fix Script

```bash
./fix-inventory-now.sh
```

**Or if that doesn't work:**
```bash
node diagnose-and-fix-inventory-sync.js
```

**What this does:**
- Analyzes your inventory
- Shows what's wrong
- Fixes it automatically (takes 10-30 seconds)

### Step 2: Apply Permanent Fix (Prevents Future Issues)

Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor, then run:

```sql
-- Copy and paste from: migrations/create_inventory_sync_trigger.sql
```

**What this does:**
- Adds automatic syncing
- Prevents this from happening again
- Fixes any existing data

### Step 3: Verify It Worked

```bash
node verify-inventory-fix.js
```

**Or check manually:**
1. Go to your inventory page
2. Refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check if products now show stock

FROM lats_product_variants pv
LEFT JOIN lats_products p ON p.id = pv.product_id
LEFT JOIN inventory_items ii ON ii.variant_id = pv.id
