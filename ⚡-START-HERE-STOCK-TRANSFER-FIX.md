## 📊 What Was Fixed

### ✅ Created Database Table
The fix creates the `branch_transfers` table with:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique transfer ID |
| `from_branch_id` | UUID | Source branch |
| `to_branch_id` | UUID | Destination branch |
| `transfer_type` | TEXT | Type: stock/customer/product |
| `entity_type` | TEXT | What's being transferred |
| `entity_id` | UUID | Product/variant ID |
| `quantity` | INTEGER | How many units |
| `status` | TEXT | pending/approved/in_transit/completed/rejected/cancelled |
| `requested_by` | UUID | Who requested |
| `approved_by` | UUID | Who approved |
| `notes` | TEXT | Transfer notes |
| `metadata` | JSONB | Additional data |
| `requested_at` | TIMESTAMP | When requested |
| `approved_at` | TIMESTAMP | When approved |
| `completed_at` | TIMESTAMP | When completed |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Creation time |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | Last update |

### ✅ Created Indexes for Performance
- `idx_branch_transfers_from_branch` - Fast lookup by source branch
- `idx_branch_transfers_to_branch` - Fast lookup by destination
- `idx_branch_transfers_status` - Filter by status
- `idx_branch_transfers_type` - Filter by type
- `idx_branch_transfers_entity` - Lookup by product/variant
- `idx_branch_transfers_created` - Sort by date

### ✅ Created Helper Functions
1. **`reduce_variant_stock(variant_id, quantity)`**
   - Reduces stock when transfer is completed
   - Validates sufficient stock available
   - Updates timestamps

2. **`increase_variant_stock(variant_id, quantity)`**  
   - Increases stock when receiving transfer
   - Updates timestamps

3. **`update_branch_transfer_timestamp()`**
   - Auto-updates `updated_at` on every change
   - Triggered automatically

### ✅ Set Correct Permissions
- Disabled RLS (Row Level Security) for Neon compatibility
- Granted full access to PUBLIC role
- Application handles authentication

### ✅ Improved Error Logging
Updated `stockTransferApi.ts` to show detailed error messages:
- Error message
- Error details
- Error hints
- Error codes

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Error persists after fix?

#### 1. Verify table exists
```sql
SELECT * FROM branch_transfers LIMIT 1;
```
Should return: `0 rows` or data (not "table doesn't exist")

#### 2. Check browser console
Open DevTools (F12) and look for detailed error messages

#### 3. Check Neon connection
Verify `.env` file:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-neon-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-neon-key
```

#### 4. Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`
- Clear site data in DevTools

#### 5. Restart dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Still stuck?

1. Run diagnostic again: `🔍-DIAGNOSE-STOCK-TRANSFER-ISSUE.sql`
2. Check if you have:
   - ✅ At least 2 active branches
   - ✅ Products with stock > 0
   - ✅ `store_locations` table
   - ✅ `lats_product_variants` table
