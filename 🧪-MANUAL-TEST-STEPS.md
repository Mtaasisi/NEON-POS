# 🧪 Manual Test Steps - Inventory Refresh Fix

## ✅ Fix Status: **READY TO TEST**

Your application is running on **http://localhost:3000**

## 📋 Step-by-Step Test Procedure

### 1. **Create a Purchase Order** (if you don't have one)

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Login with `care@care.com` / `123456`
3. Navigate to **Inventory → Purchase Orders → Create New**
4. Fill in the form:
   - Select a supplier
   - Add at least 1 product with quantity
   - Save the purchase order
5. Change the PO status to **"sent"** or **"pending"**

### 2. **Open Two Browser Windows** (This is the key test!)

**Window 1 - Inventory Page:**
1. Open http://localhost:3000/lats/inventory
2. Note the current stock quantities
3. **Keep this window open and visible**
4. **Open Browser Console (F12)** - you'll see the magic happen here!

**Window 2 - Purchase Order:**
1. Open http://localhost:3000/lats/purchase-orders
2. Find your purchase order
3. Click to open the details

### 3. **The Test - Receive the Purchase Order**

1. In Window 2 (Purchase Order detail):
   - Click the **"Receive"** or **"Mark as Received"** button
   - Confirm the action

2. **Watch Window 1 (Inventory Page):**
   - ✅ Within 1-2 seconds, you should see the stock quantities UPDATE AUTOMATICALLY
   - ✅ You should NOT need to manually refresh the page
   - ✅ In the console, you should see:
     ```
     ✅ [PurchaseOrderService] Purchase order received event emitted
     📦 [UnifiedInventoryPage] Purchase order received, refreshing inventory...
     ```

### 4. **Success Criteria**

✅ **PASS** if:
- Inventory updates automatically within 2 seconds
- No manual refresh (F5) needed
- Console shows the event emission logs
- Stock quantities reflect the received items

❌ **FAIL** if:
- Inventory doesn't update automatically
- You have to manually refresh to see changes
- No console logs about events

## 🎯 Quick Single-Tab Test

If you don't want to use two windows:

1. Go to Inventory page
2. Open Console (F12)
3. Navigate to Purchase Orders (keep console open)
4. Receive a purchase order
5. Go back to Inventory page
6. **Watch**: It should refresh automatically within 1-2 seconds
7. **Check console**: You should see the event logs

## 📊 What You're Testing

**Before the fix:**
- Receive PO → Go to inventory → Old data shown → Must hit F5 → See new data

**After the fix:**
- Receive PO → Go to inventory → New data shows automatically → No F5 needed!

## 🔍 Console Logs to Look For

When you receive a purchase order, you should see these logs in order:

```
✅ [PurchaseOrderService] Purchase order received event emitted
📦 [UnifiedInventoryPage] Purchase order received, refreshing inventory...
🔍 [LiveInventoryService] Fetching live inventory metrics...
✅ Products loaded successfully
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Use Chrome/Edge for best results** - they have the best DevTools
2. **Keep console open during the test** - it's the easiest way to verify
3. **Test with small quantities first** - easier to spot changes
4. **Try receiving multiple times** - each time should trigger a refresh

## 🎬 Video Test

If you want to record the test:
1. Use screen recording (QuickTime on Mac, Game Bar on Windows)
2. Show both windows side-by-side
3. Receive the PO on one side
4. Watch the other side update automatically
5. This makes a great demo video!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Problem**: No console logs appear
- **Solution**: Make sure you're on the inventory page when receiving
- **Solution**: Try refreshing the inventory page once, then receive another PO

**Problem**: Inventory doesn't update
- **Solution**: Check console for JavaScript errors
- **Solution**: Make sure the PO status is changing to "received"

**Problem**: Updates are delayed more than 2 seconds
- **Solution**: This is normal if database is slow (Neon cold start)
- **Solution**: Subsequent receives should be faster

## ✅ Test Complete!

Once you see the automatic refresh working, the fix is confirmed to be working perfectly! 🎉
