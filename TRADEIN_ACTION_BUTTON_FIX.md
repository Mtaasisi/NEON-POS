# Trade-In Management Action Button Fix

## Problem

The action button (View Details) in the Trade-In Management page was not functional. It only displayed a placeholder toast message saying "View details coming soon" instead of actually showing the transaction details.

## Solution

Created a comprehensive Trade-In Details Modal and integrated it into the Trade-In History tab.

---

## Files Created

### 1. `TradeInDetailsModal.tsx`
**Location:** `src/features/lats/components/tradeIn/TradeInDetailsModal.tsx`

A complete modal component that displays:

#### Device Information
- Device name and model
- IMEI and serial number
- Visual device icon

#### Customer Information
- Customer name
- Phone number
- Email address

#### Condition Assessment
- Overall condition rating (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)
- Color-coded condition badges
- Damage deductions
- Repair status flags
- Damage notes

#### Pricing Breakdown
- Base trade-in price
- Damage deductions breakdown
- Final trade-in value (highlighted)

#### Transaction Details
- Transaction number
- Transaction date and time
- Contract signature status
- Additional notes

#### Visual Features
- **Color-coded status badges** (Pending/Approved/Completed/Cancelled)
- **Gradient backgrounds** for pricing section
- **Icon indicators** for all sections
- **Responsive layout** (works on mobile and desktop)
- **Scrollable content** for long details
- **Sticky header and footer** for easy navigation

## Files Modified

### 1. `TradeInHistoryTab.tsx`
**Location:** `src/features/lats/components/tradeIn/TradeInHistoryTab.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. **Added import** for `TradeInDetailsModal`
2. **Added state** to track selected transaction:
   ```typescript
   const [selectedTransaction, setSelectedTransaction] = useState<TradeInTransaction | null>(null);
   ```
3. **Updated View Details button** (line 383-390):
   - Before: `toast.info('View details coming soon')`
   - After: `setSelectedTransaction(transaction)`
4. **Added modal render** at the bottom of the component:
   ```tsx
   {selectedTransaction && (
     <TradeInDetailsModal
       transaction={selectedTransaction}
       onClose={() => setSelectedTransaction(null)}
     />
   )}
   ```

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User navigates to **Trade-In Management** page
2. Clicks on **History & Reports** tab
3. Sees list of all trade-in transactions
4. Clicks the **Eye icon** (View Details) button on any transaction
5. **Details Modal opens** showing comprehensive transaction information
6. User can scroll through all details
7. Clicks **Close** button to dismiss modal

### Technical Flow
```
TradeInHistoryTab
  └─ Transaction List
      └─ View Details Button (onClick)
          └─ setSelectedTransaction(transaction)
              └─ Renders TradeInDetailsModal
                  └─ Displays full transaction details
```
