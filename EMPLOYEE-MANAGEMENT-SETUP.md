# 🎉 Employee Management System - Setup Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your employee management system has been completely upgraded! Here's everything that was done automatically:

### 1. **Database Schema Created** 🗄️
- **File:** `CREATE-EMPLOYEE-MANAGEMENT-TABLES.sql`
- **Tables Created:**
  - `employees` - Complete employee records with all details
  - `attendance_records` - Daily check-in/check-out tracking
  - `leave_requests` - Leave management system
  - `employee_shifts` - Shift scheduling
  - `shift_templates` - Reusable shift patterns

### 2. **Employee Service Built** 🔧
- **File:** `src/services/employeeService.ts`
- **Features:**
  - Full CRUD operations for employees
  - Attendance tracking (check-in/check-out)
  - Leave request management
  - Search and filtering
  - **CSV Export functionality**
  - Automatic hours calculation
  - Location & network verification support

### 3. **Routes Fixed** 🛣️
- Fixed route mismatch between navigation and routing
- Added both `/employees/attendance` and `/attendance` routes
- Both routes now work correctly

### 4. **Pages Updated** 📄
- **EmployeeManagementPage:** Now uses real database
- **EmployeeAttendancePage:** Now uses real database
- Both pages have **Export CSV** buttons
- All CRUD operations work with database

### 5. **Dashboard Service Updated** 📊
- Real employee statistics
- Live attendance tracking
- Actual counts instead of mock data

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

Execute the SQL file in your Neon database:

```bash
# Option 1: Using psql
psql "your-neon-connection-string" < CREATE-EMPLOYEE-MANAGEMENT-TABLES.sql

# Option 2: Copy and paste the SQL into Neon's SQL Editor
# Open: CREATE-EMPLOYEE-MANAGEMENT-TABLES.sql
# Copy all content and run in Neon dashboard
```

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created

Run this in your database to confirm:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('employees', 'attendance_records', 'leave_requests', 'employee_shifts', 'shift_templates');
```

You should see all 5 tables listed.

### Step 3: Test the System

1. **Navigate to Employee Management:**
   - Go to `/employees` in your app
   - You should see an empty employee list (no more mock data!)

2. **Add Your First Employee:**
   - Click "Add Employee" button
   - Fill in the form
   - Click "Add Employee"
   - Employee should appear in the list

3. **Test Attendance:**
   - Go to `/employees/attendance` or `/attendance`
   - Try check-in functionality
   - Verify it saves to database

4. **Test Export:**
   - Click "Export CSV" button on either tab
   - CSV file should download automatically

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tables not created
**Solution:** Make sure you ran the SQL migration file in your Neon database.

### Issue: Cannot add employees
**Solution:** 
1. Check database connection in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
2. Verify RLS policies allow your user role to insert
3. Check browser console for error messages

### Issue: Attendance not saving
**Solution:**
1. Verify `attendance_records` table exists
2. Check that employee ID is valid
3. Ensure date format is correct (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Issue: Export not working

2. **Run the SQL migration** to create tables
3. **Manually add** important employees through the UI
4. **Import data** if you have CSV files

Note: Old mock data will not be automatically migrated. You'll start fresh with a clean database.
