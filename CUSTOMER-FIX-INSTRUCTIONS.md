# 🔧 Customer Status Functions Fix

## 📋 Problem Summary

Your application was encountering several database errors:
- ❌ `function get_customer_status(unknown) does not exist`
- ❌ `function track_customer_activity(unknown, unknown) does not exist`
- ❌ Errors fetching customer returns
- ❌ Errors fetching customer preferences

## ✅ Solution

I've created a comprehensive SQL fix that:
1. Creates missing database tables (`customer_preferences`, `returns`, `customer_checkins`)
2. Creates all missing database functions for customer status tracking
3. Adds necessary columns to the customers table
4. Sets up indexes for optimal performance
5. Configures triggers for automatic updates

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Using the Auto-Run Script (Recommended)

Simply run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node run-customer-fix.mjs
```

### Option 2: Manual Application via Neon Console

1. Log in to your [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech)
2. Select your project and database
3. Go to the SQL Editor
4. Copy the entire contents of `🔧 FIX-CUSTOMER-STATUS-FUNCTIONS.sql`
5. Paste into the SQL Editor
6. Click "Run" to execute

### Option 3: Using psql Command Line

```bash
psql "YOUR_DATABASE_URL" -f "🔧 FIX-CUSTOMER-STATUS-FUNCTIONS.sql"
```

## 📦 What Gets Created

### Tables
- `customer_preferences` - Stores customer communication preferences
- `returns` - Manages product returns and exchanges
- `customer_checkins` - Tracks customer visits and check-ins

### Functions
- `get_customer_status(customer_id)` - Gets comprehensive customer status
- `track_customer_activity(customer_id, activity_type)` - Tracks customer activities
- `update_customer_activity(customer_id)` - Updates and reactivates customers
- `deactivate_inactive_customers()` - Auto-deactivates customers inactive 60+ days
- `get_inactive_customers()` - Lists all inactive customers

### Indexes
- Performance indexes on customer_id, status, dates, etc.

### Triggers
- Automatic timestamp updates for modified records

## 🔍 Verification

After running the fix, you should see output like:

```
✅ CUSTOMER STATUS SYSTEM FIX COMPLETE!
📊 Functions created: 5 / 5
📋 Tables created: 3 / 3
```

## 🎯 After Applying the Fix

1. **Restart your application** (if it's currently running)
2. **Clear browser cache** (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
3. **Test customer features** - The errors should be gone!
4. **Monitor console** - No more "function does not exist" errors

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If you get permission errors:
- Ensure your database user has CREATE TABLE and CREATE FUNCTION permissions
- Contact your Neon database administrator

### If tables already exist:
- The script uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so it's safe to run multiple times
- Existing data will not be affected

### If foreign key errors occur:
- The script handles missing referenced tables gracefully
- Foreign keys are added only if the referenced tables exist

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Verify your DATABASE_URL is correct
3. Ensure the `customers` table exists in your database
4. Check Neon dashboard for any database connection issues
