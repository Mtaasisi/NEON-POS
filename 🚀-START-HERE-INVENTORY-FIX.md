# 🚀 Products Not Showing in Inventory - Quick Fix Guide

Hey! Let's get your products showing up. This is a step-by-step guide to diagnose and fix the issue.

## 🎯 Quick Diagnosis

The problem could be in one of two places:
1. **Database** - Products exist but have issues (inactive, missing data, etc.)
2. **Frontend** - Products exist and are fine, but filtering/display logic is hiding them

Let's check both!

---

## Step 1: Check Database (5 minutes)

### Run the SQL Fix Script

1. **Connect to your Neon database** (use your preferred SQL client)

2. **Run this SQL file:**
   ```
   FIX-INVENTORY-NOT-SHOWING.sql
   ```

3. **Look at the output** - it will tell you:
   - How many products you have
   - If they're active or inactive
   - If they have categories
   - If they have variants
   - And **automatically fix** common issues!

### What This Fixes:

✅ Activates all inactive products  
✅ Creates "Uncategorized" category for products without categories  
✅ Creates default variants for products missing variants  
✅ Updates stock quantities  

### Expected Output:

```
📦 Total Products: 6
✅ Active Products: 6
📊 Final Product Status: 6 active_products
📦 Products with Variants: 6
✅ All fixes applied!
```

## Step 2: Check Frontend (3 minutes)

If the database looks good but products still don't show:

### Open Browser Console

1. Go to your inventory page
2. Press **F12** (Windows) or **Cmd+Option+I** (Mac)
3. Click the **Console** tab

### Look for These Logs:

```
🔍 [latsProductApi] Starting to fetch products...
✅ [latsProductApi] Found X products
```

### Common Issues and Fixes:

| What You See | What It Means | Fix |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| `Found 0 products` | Database query returning empty | Run SQL fix script |
| `Failed to fetch products` | Database connection issue | Check `.env` file |
| `Products: []` in console | Filters hiding products | Reset filters (see below) |
| Red errors in console | JavaScript error | Check specific error message |

### Reset Filters

If products are loaded but not showing, **reset all filters**:

Run this in the browser console:
```javascript
setSearchTerm('');
setSelectedCategory('all');
setStockFilter('all');
setShowLowStockOnly(false);
```

---

## Step 3: Force Refresh (1 minute)

After fixing database or frontend issues:

1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+Del (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Del (Mac)
2. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. **Force reload products** (in browser console):
   ```javascript
   forceRefreshProducts();
   ```

## 🎯 Most Common Fixes

### Fix 1: Products Inactive
**Symptom:** Database has products but they're not showing  
**Solution:** Run `FIX-INVENTORY-NOT-SHOWING.sql` - it activates all products

### Fix 2: Products Missing Variants
**Symptom:** Products show in database but not in UI  
**Solution:** Run `FIX-INVENTORY-NOT-SHOWING.sql` - it creates default variants

### Fix 3: Filters Too Restrictive
**Symptom:** Console shows products loaded but UI is empty  
**Solution:** Reset all filters (see above)

### Fix 4: Browser Cache
**Symptom:** Fixed database but still don't see products  
**Solution:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) and clear cache

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

If products still don't show after following all steps:

1. **Check exact error message** in browser console
2. **Check network tab** in DevTools - look for failed requests
3. **Verify Supabase connection** in your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
   ```
4. **Test database connection** in console:
   ```javascript
   supabase.from('lats_products').select('count').then(console.log);
   ```
