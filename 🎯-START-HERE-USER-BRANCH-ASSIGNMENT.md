# 🎯 START HERE - User Branch Assignment Feature

## 🎉 What's New?

You can now **assign users to specific branches** or give them **access to all branches**!

This was the missing feature you requested in user management. Now you have full control over which users can access which branches/stores.

## 🔍 How It Works Behind the Scenes

1. **Database Table**: `user_branch_assignments`
   - Links users to branches
   - Stores permissions per branch
   - Tracks primary branch

2. **When User Has NO Assignments**:
   - Treated as "Access All Branches"
   - Can see data from all locations

3. **When User HAS Assignments**:
   - Can ONLY see data from assigned branches
   - Branch selector dropdown shows only assigned branches
   - All queries automatically filtered

4. **Admin Users**:
   - Always have access to all branches
   - Regardless of assignments

---

## 📊 Verify It's Working

### Check in Database:

```sql
-- See all user-branch assignments
SELECT 
  u.email,
  sl.name as branch,
  uba.is_primary
FROM user_branch_assignments uba
JOIN users u ON uba.user_id = u.id
JOIN store_locations sl ON uba.branch_id = sl.id
ORDER BY u.email;
```

### Check in Application:

1. Login as a user with limited branch access
2. Check branch selector dropdown
3. ✅ Should only show assigned branches
4. Navigate to Customers/Sales pages
5. ✅ Should only show data from assigned branches
