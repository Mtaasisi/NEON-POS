# 🚀 Quick Migration Guide - Auto Fix Database

## ⚡ Method 1: Automatic (Recommended)

### Using Node.js Script:

```bash
# Install pg module first (if not installed)
npm install pg

# Run the migration
node run-day-sessions-migration.js
```

### Using Shell Script:

```bash
# Set your database URL first
export DATABASE_URL='your-neon-connection-string-here'

# Run the script
./apply-migration.sh
```

---

## 📋 Method 2: Manual (Easiest)

**Just copy and paste in Neon dashboard:**

1. Open **Neon Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the entire content of **`setup-day-sessions-SIMPLE.sql`**
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"**
5. Done! ✅

## 🔍 Method 3: Using psql Command Line

If you have PostgreSQL client installed:

```bash
# Get your connection string from .env
source .env

# Run the migration
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f setup-day-sessions-SIMPLE.sql
```

---

## 📦 What Gets Created

✅ **`daily_opening_sessions`** table  
✅ Indexes for fast queries  
✅ Trigger to auto-close sessions  
✅ Function to manage session state  

---

## ✅ Verify It Worked

Run this in SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Should return the new table structure
SELECT * FROM daily_opening_sessions LIMIT 1;
```

## 🎯 After Migration

Your POS will automatically:
- ✅ Create sessions when you open the app
- ✅ Track session start times
- ✅ Filter transactions by session
- ✅ Reset counter when you open a new day

Just start your app and it works! 🎉

npm run dev
```

npm install pg
```

### "Permission denied" error:
```bash

```

### "DATABASE_URL not set" error:
```bash
