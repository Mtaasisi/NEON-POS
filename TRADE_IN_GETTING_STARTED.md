## 📊 PRICING STRATEGY TIPS

### **Setting Base Prices:**

1. **Research Market:**
   - Check online marketplaces
   - See what competitors offer
   - Consider device popularity

2. **Calculate Your Margins:**
   ```
   Base Price = Market Value × 70-80%
   
   Example:
   Market Value: TSh 800,000
   Your Base Price: TSh 600,000 (75%)
   Resale Price: TSh 750,000
   Profit: TSh 150,000
   ```

3. **Adjust by Condition:**
   - Excellent (100%): Like new
   - Good (85%): Minor wear
   - Fair (70%): Visible wear
   - Poor (50%): Heavy damage

---

### **Damage Deductions:**

Link to your spare parts prices:
- Cracked screen = Screen replacement price
- Broken back = Back glass price
- Battery issues = Battery price
- Camera problems = Camera module price

**Example:**
```
iPhone 13 Pro - Good Condition
Base Price: TSh 600,000
Good Multiplier: 85% = TSh 510,000
- Cracked back glass: -TSh 50,000
= Final Value: TSh 460,000
```
