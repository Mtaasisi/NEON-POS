\i backup-before-fix.sql

# 3. Check what's wrong
\i diagnose-sales-problem.sql

# 4. Apply the fix
\i fix-sales-total-amount-overflow.sql

# 5. Verify it worked
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as sales_today,
    SUM(total_amount) as total,
    AVG(total_amount) as average
FROM lats_sales
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE;
