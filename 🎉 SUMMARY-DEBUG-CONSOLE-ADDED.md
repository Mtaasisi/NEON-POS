## 🎯 How It Works

### The Debug Flow:

```
User clicks "Add Customer"
    ↓
🎯 AddCustomerModal logs form data
    ↓
🚀 CustomersContext logs business logic
    ↓
💾 customerApi logs database operations
    ↓
Either:
✅ Success (detailed success logs)
OR
❌ Error (comprehensive error logs with solution)
```

---

## 📊 Example Console Output

### Success:
```javascript
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎯 AddCustomerModal: Starting customer creation process
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📝 Form data: { name: "John Doe", phone: "+255..." }
🚀 CustomersContext: Starting...
✅ User authenticated: user-id
🆔 Generated ID: customer-uuid
💾 customerApi: Starting database insert
✅ Mapped: name → name = "John Doe"
✅ Mapped: phone → phone = "+255..."
✅ Database insert successful!
✅ Welcome note added
🎉 Customer creation completed!
```

### Error:
```javascript
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
❌ DATABASE INSERT FAILED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Error Message: null value in column "id"
Error Code: 23502
Error Details: Failing row contains (...)
Error Hint: Add default value for "id"
Database object: { name: "John", phone: "+255..." }
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
💬 User message: Missing required field
```
