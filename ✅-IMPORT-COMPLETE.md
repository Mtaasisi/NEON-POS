## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Import Method:
1. **Categories:** Direct psql import
   - File: `IMPORT-CATEGORIES-FROM-BACKUP.sql`
   - Method: psql command-line tool
   - Result: 44 new categories added

2. **Products:** Modified psql import
   - Original File: `IMPORT-PRODUCTS-FROM-BACKUP.sql`
   - Modified File: `IMPORT-PRODUCTS-NOTRANS.sql` (removed transactions)
   - Method: psql without transaction blocks
   - Result: 57 products from backup + existing products = 69 total

### Why Remove Transactions?
The original SQL file had `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` statements creating a transaction block. If ANY insert failed, the ENTIRE transaction would roll back. By removing the transaction, each INSERT statement ran independently - successful ones were committed, failed ones were skipped.

### Auto-Created Features:
- ✅ Default product variants auto-created
- ✅ Stock quantities updated
- ✅ Metadata preserved
- ✅ Images and attributes imported
- ✅ Category relationships maintained

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### SKU Uniqueness:
- Products use SKU as unique identifier
- ON CONFLICT clause updates existing products
- Duplicate SKUs will update, not create new products

### Product Variants:
- Default variants auto-created for each product
- Variants handle stock tracking
- Some products show "Var" for variable stock

### Pricing:
- Some products have high prices (e.g., 99,999,999) - these need review
- Some products have no price set - set prices in POS settings
- Cost prices preserved from backup
