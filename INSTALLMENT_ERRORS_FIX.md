# Installment Errors Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Frontend Crash: `plan.installment_amount.toFixed is not a function`**

**Problem**: The `plan.installment_amount` field was coming from the database as either a string or undefined, causing `.toFixed()` to fail.

**Solution**: 
- Changed the code to safely convert to number: `Number(plan.installment_amount || 0)`
- Added data transformation in `installmentService.ts` to ensure all numeric fields are properly typed

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/installments/pages/InstallmentsPage.tsx` (line 947)
- `src/lib/installmentService.ts` (getAllInstallmentPlans and getInstallmentPlanById methods)

### 2. **Database Error: `column "installment_number" does not exist`**

**Problem**: The `installment_payments` table was missing the `installment_number` column.

**Solution**: 
- Created migration file: `migrations/add_installment_number_column.sql`
- Changed query to use `created_at` instead of `installment_number` for ordering until migration is run
- Created script to run the migration: `run-installment-number-fix.mjs`

## How to Apply the Database Fix

### Option 1: Run the Migration Script (Recommended)

```bash
node run-installment-number-fix.mjs
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL (If script doesn't work)

Copy and paste this SQL into your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_name = 'installment_payments' 
        AND column_name = 'installment_number'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE installment_payments 
        ADD COLUMN installment_number INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
        
        RAISE NOTICE 'Added installment_number column to installment_payments';
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'installment_number column already exists in installment_payments';
    END IF;
END $$;
```

## After Running the Migration

Once the `installment_number` column is added to the database, you can optionally update the query in `installmentService.ts` line 388 back to:

```typescript
.order('installment_number', { ascending: true });
```

Currently it uses `created_at` which works fine but `installment_number` is more semantically correct.

## Data Transformation Improvements

Added automatic conversion of numeric fields from database strings to proper numbers:
- `total_amount`
- `down_payment`
- `amount_financed`
- `total_paid`
- `balance_due`
- `installment_amount`
- `number_of_installments`
- `installments_paid`
- `late_fee_amount`
- `late_fee_applied`
- `days_overdue`
- `reminder_count`

This ensures consistent data types throughout the application.

## Testing

After applying these fixes:

1. ✅ The frontend should no longer crash when opening the payment modal
2. ✅ Data should display correctly with proper number formatting
3. ✅ Database queries should work without `installment_number` errors

Test by:
1. Opening the Installments page
2. Clicking "Record Payment" on any plan
3. Verify the modal opens without errors
4. Check that amounts display correctly
