npm install react-signature-canvas
npm install @types/react-signature-canvas --save-dev
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migration
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f migrations/create_trade_in_system.sql
```

### Step 3: Add Routes to Your Router
```typescript
import TradeInPricingPage from './features/lats/pages/TradeInPricingPage';
import TradeInHistoryPage from './features/lats/pages/TradeInHistoryPage';

// Add these routes
{
  path: '/trade-in/pricing',

  icon: DollarSign,
  path: '/trade-in/pricing',
},
{
  name: 'Trade-In History',
  icon: History,
  path: '/trade-in/history',
}
```

### Step 5: Integrate into POS

## üí° How It Works

### Admin Setup (One-Time):
1. Go to **Trade-In Pricing** page
2. Click "Add Trade-In Price"
3. Enter device name and model
4. Set base trade-in price
5. Adjust condition multipliers if needed
6. Save and activate

### During a Sale:
1. Customer brings old device + wants new device
2. Staff adds new device to cart in POS
3. Staff clicks **"Add Trade-In"** button
4. **Calculator opens**:
   - Select old device model
   - Enter IMEI
   - Assess condition (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)
   - Add any damage (auto-deducts spare part prices)
   - Review final trade-in value
5. **Contract generated**:
   - Customer enters ID information
   - Reviews terms & conditions
   - Signs electronically
   - Staff signs
6. **Trade-in applied**:
   - Trade-in value credited to sale
   - Customer pays difference
   - Device added to inventory
7. **Complete sale**

### After Trade-In:
1. Device automatically added to inventory
2. If needs repair:
   - Mark as "Needs Repair"
   - Send to repair department
   - Update when fixed
3. When ready:
   - Set resale price
   - Mark as "Ready for Resale"
   - Device appears in POS for selling
