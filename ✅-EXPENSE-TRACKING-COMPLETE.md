# ✅ Expense Tracking in Payment Accounts - COMPLETE!

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** 🎉 COMPLETE  

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Problem:
- ❌ Expenses weren't reducing payment account balances automatically
- ❌ No clear tracking of expenses per account
- ❌ Manual balance updates were needed

### Solution:
- ✅ **Automatic expense tracking** via database triggers
- ✅ **Expenses reduce balances** instantly when recorded
- ✅ **Transaction history** shows all expenses
- ✅ **Expense categories** for better organization
- ✅ **Before/after balance** tracking on each expense

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### When You Record an Expense:

```
1. Expense recorded → account_transactions table
   └─ transaction_type: 'expense'
   └─ amount: expense amount

2. Trigger fires automatically
   └─ Calculates: new_balance = current_balance - expense_amount
   └─ Updates finance_accounts.balance
   └─ Records balance_before and balance_after

3. UI updates in real-time
   └─ Shows reduced balance
   └─ Displays expense in transaction history
```

## 📊 Current Account Status

Your payment accounts are now properly tracking expenses:

| Account | Current Balance | Total Received | Total Expenses |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| M-Pesa | TSh 1,507,253 | TSh 1,507,253 | TSh 0 |
| CRDB Bank | TSh 1,502,930 | TSh 1,502,930 | TSh 0 |
| Cash | TSh 56,924.50 | TSh 58,924.50 | TSh 0* |
| Tigo Pesa | TSh 48,332 | TSh 48,332 | TSh 0 |
| Card Payments | TSh 4,748 | TSh 4,748 | TSh 0 |

*Note: Cash account balance (TSh 56,924.50) is less than received (TSh 58,924.50), suggesting TSh 2,000 in expenses or payments made.*

## 🔧 Database Components Created

### 1. **Updated Trigger Function**
```sql
update_account_balance()
```

**Handles:**
- ✅ `payment_received` → Increases balance
- ✅ `transfer_in` → Increases balance
- ✅ `expense` → **Decreases balance** 💰
- ✅ `payment_made` → Decreases balance
- ✅ `transfer_out` → Decreases balance
- ✅ `adjustment` → Sets specific balance

### 2. **Expense Categories Table**
Created 10 common expense categories:

| Category | Icon | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Rent | 🏢 | Office or shop rent payments |
| Utilities | 💡 | Electricity, water, internet |
| Salaries | 💰 | Employee salaries and wages |
| Supplies | 📦 | Office and shop supplies |
| Maintenance | 🔧 | Repairs and maintenance |
| Marketing | 📢 | Advertising and marketing |
| Transportation | 🚗 | Fuel, transport costs |
| Insurance | 🛡️ | Business insurance |
| Taxes | 📝 | Business taxes and fees |
| Other | 📌 | Miscellaneous expenses |

## 💡 How to Record Expenses

### Method 1: Direct Account Transaction (Current)
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('account_transactions')
  .insert({
    account_id: 'account-uuid',
    transaction_type: 'expense',
    amount: 5000,
    description: 'Office rent payment',
    reference_number: 'RENT-OCT-2025'
  });

// Balance automatically reduced by TSh 5,000! ✅
```

### Method 2: Using Expense Categories
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('expense_categories')
  .select('*')
  .eq('name', 'Rent');

// Then record expense with category
```

  (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM account_transactions 
   WHERE account_id = fa.id AND transaction_type = 'payment_received') as received,
  (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM account_transactions 
   WHERE account_id = fa.id AND transaction_type = 'expense') as expenses
FROM finance_accounts fa
WHERE name = 'Cash';
```

### View Recent Expenses:

```sql
SELECT 
  at.created_at,
  fa.name as account,
  at.description,
  at.amount,
  at.balance_before,
  at.balance_after
FROM account_transactions at
JOIN finance_accounts fa ON fa.id = at.account_id
WHERE at.transaction_type = 'expense'
ORDER BY at.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
