# 🏪 Customer Branch Tracking - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Database Schema (`ADD-CUSTOMER-BRANCH-LABEL.sql`)
- ✅ Added `created_by_branch_id` column to track which branch created each customer
- ✅ Added `created_by_branch_name` column for quick display (denormalized for performance)
- ✅ Created index on `created_by_branch_id` for better query performance
- ✅ Updated existing customers to assign them to main branch
- ✅ Created trigger to automatically populate branch name when branch ID is set
- ✅ Created `customers_with_branch_info` view for easier querying

### 2. TypeScript Types (`src/types.ts`)
- ✅ Added `createdByBranchId?: string` to Customer interface
- ✅ Added `createdByBranchName?: string` to Customer interface

### 3. Customer API (`src/lib/customerApi/core.ts`)
- ✅ Updated `addCustomerToDb` function to **automatically capture** current branch
- ✅ Added field mappings for `createdByBranchId` and `createdByBranchName`
- ✅ Automatic branch capture happens when:
  - Customer is created through the form
  - Branch ID is read from `localStorage.current_branch_id`
  - Branch name is fetched from database for display

### 4. Sales Reports (`src/features/lats/pages/SalesReportsPage.tsx`)
- ✅ Added branch isolation filter to sales queries
- ✅ Now sales are filtered by current branch
- ✅ Consistent with `deduplicatedQueries.ts` branch filtering

## 🎯 How It Works

### When Creating a Customer:
```typescript
1. User fills out customer form
2. Current branch ID is read from localStorage
3. Branch name is fetched from store_locations table
4. Both values are automatically added to customer record
5. Customer is saved with branch label
```

### Branch Tracking Philosophy:
- 📊 **Customers are SHARED** across all branches (not isolated)
- 🏷️ **Branch label is informational only** - shows which branch originally created the customer
- 🔍 **All branches can view and interact** with all customers
- 📍 **The label helps identify** customer origin for reporting and tracking

## 🎨 Displaying Branch Labels

### Option 1: Badge in Customer List
```tsx
{customer.createdByBranchName && (
  <span className="px-2 py-1 text-xs bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 rounded-full">
    🏪 {customer.createdByBranchName}
  </span>
)}
```

### Option 2: Subtle Text Label
```tsx
{customer.createdByBranchName && (
  <span className="text-xs text-gray-500">
    Added by: {customer.createdByBranchName}
  </span>
)}
```

### Option 3: Icon with Tooltip
```tsx
{customer.createdByBranchName && (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-1" title={`Created by ${customer.createdByBranchName}`}>
    <Building2 className="w-3 h-3 text-gray-400" />
    <span className="text-xs text-gray-500">{customer.createdByBranchName}</span>
  </div>
)}
```

## 📋 Next Steps

### To Apply Database Changes:
```bash
# Run this SQL file in your Neon database console:
ADD-CUSTOMER-BRANCH-LABEL.sql
```

### To Display Branch Labels:
1. Open customer list components
2. Add branch label display where appropriate
3. Choose one of the display options above

### Where to Add Labels:
- ✅ Customer list/table views
- ✅ Customer detail/profile pages
- ✅ Customer search results
- ✅ Customer cards/modals

## 🔍 Verification

After applying the SQL migration, you can verify:

```sql
-- Check if columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'customers' 
  AND column_name IN ('created_by_branch_id', 'created_by_branch_name');

-- Check customer branch distribution
SELECT 
    created_by_branch_name,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY created_by_branch_name
ORDER BY customer_count DESC;

-- View customers with branch info
SELECT 
    name,
    phone,
    created_by_branch_name,
    created_at
FROM customers
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 📊 Benefits

1. **Track Customer Origin** - Know which branch brought in each customer
2. **Performance Reports** - Analyze which branches are bringing in more customers
3. **Staff Accountability** - Track which locations are most active in customer acquisition
4. **No Data Isolation** - Customers remain accessible to all branches
5. **Automatic Tracking** - No manual input required from staff

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Customers are still SHARED** - the branch field is just a label
- **All branches can access all customers** - no restrictions
- **Branch label is set at creation time** and doesn't change
- **If no branch is selected**, customer will have NULL branch (trigger will handle it)
- **Legacy customers** will be assigned to main branch automatically

## 🎉 Result

Now when customers are created:
```
✅ Customer: John Doe
📱 Phone: +255 123 456 789
🏪 Created by: ARUSHA Branch
📅 Date: 2025-10-13
```

The branch tracking is automatic and transparent to users! 🚀
