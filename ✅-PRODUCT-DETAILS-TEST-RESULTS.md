## 💡 **Observations**

### Display Method
The product details are shown **directly on the page** rather than in a modal/popup. This is a valid design choice and works well.

**Pros:**
- Full page available for information
- Can show more details
- Better for complex products with many variants
- Easier to bookmark/share specific product URLs

**Cons:**
- Requires navigation back to list
- Not as quick for viewing multiple products

### Images
Product images were not detected in the test. This could mean:
1. Test products don't have images uploaded
2. Images are in a different location on the page
3. Image upload/display needs testing

**Recommendation:** Test image upload separately if needed.
