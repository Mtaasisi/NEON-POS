## 🎯 Advanced Features to Use

↓

```

**Setup:**

- Manager reviews daily
- Only approved expenses hit accounts

### 2. Receipt Management

**Best Practice:**
1. Take photo of receipt
2. Upload to cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox)
3. Add link to expense.receipt_url
4. Add receipt number to expense.receipt_number

**Benefits:**

### 3. Vendor Tracking

**For repeat vendors:**
- Keep vendor list in separate table

### 4. Budget vs Actual Reports

**Monthly comparison:**
```sql
SELECT 
  category,
  budgeted_amount,
  actual_amount,
  (actual_amount - budgeted_amount) as variance,
  ROUND((actual_amount / budgeted_amount * 100), 2) as percentage
FROM budget_tracking
WHERE month = '2025-10';
```

## 🔥 Power User Tips

### Tip 1: Batch Entry

**For end-of-day reconciliation:**
```
Add multiple small expenses at once
Use consistent naming: "Petty Cash - [Date] - [Items]"
Attach summary receipt
```

### Tip 2: Recurring Expenses Template

**Create monthly template:**
```
Rent: TSh 500,000 (account: Cash)
TANESCO: TSh 150,000 (account: CRDB Bank)
Internet: TSh 50,000 (account: Cash)
Salaries: TSh 800,000 (account: CRDB Bank)
```

**Each month:** Copy template, adjust amounts, save.

### Tip 3: Split Expenses

**For shared costs:**
```
Title: "Utilities - 50% allocation"
Description: "Total TSh 300,000, our share TSh 150,000"
Amount: 150,000
```

### Tip 4: Expense Tags

**Use metadata for custom tags:**
```json
{
  "tags": ["recurring", "tax-deductible", "urgent"],
  "project": "Branch Expansion",
  "cost_center": "Operations"
}
```
