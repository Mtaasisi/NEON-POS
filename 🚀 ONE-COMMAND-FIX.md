# 🚀 ONE-COMMAND FIX FOR IMAGE UPLOAD

## ⚡ Fix Everything Automatically

Just run these 2 commands:

### Step 1: Fix Database (Automatic)

```bash
# In your Neon/Supabase SQL Editor:
\i AUTO-FIX-IMAGE-UPLOAD.sql
```

**This automatically:**
- ✅ Creates `product_images` table
- ✅ Adds all necessary indexes
- ✅ Disables RLS for Neon
- ✅ Grants permissions
- ✅ Sets up triggers
- ✅ Migrates legacy images
- ✅ Verifies everything

**Time**: 2 seconds

---

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket (Automatic)

**Option A: Automated Script** (If you have service role key)

```bash
# In your terminal:
node auto-create-storage-bucket.mjs
```

**This automatically:**
- ✅ Reads your `.env` file
- ✅ Connects to Supabase
- ✅ Creates `product-images` bucket
- ✅ Sets it to Public
- ✅ Configures file limits
- ✅ Verifies creation

**Time**: 5 seconds

---

**Option B: Manual** (If script fails - takes 30 seconds)

If the script says you need a service role key:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **Storage** → **Create bucket**
4. Name: `product-images`
5. Check **Public bucket** ✅
6. Click **Create**

---

## 🎯 That's It!

After running these 2 commands:

1. Refresh your app (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Go to Add Product page
3. Try uploading an image
4. Should work! 🎉

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### For Step 1 (SQL Script):
- Access to Neon SQL Editor or Supabase SQL Editor

### For Step 2 (Auto Script):
- Node.js installed
- `.env` file with Supabase credentials:
  ```env
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
  VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
  ```

**Get your SERVICE ROLE key:**
1. Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
2. Copy `service_role` key (secret key, keep it safe!)
3. Add to `.env` file

---

## 📊 What Gets Fixed

### Database (AUTO-FIX-IMAGE-UPLOAD.sql):
```sql
✅ product_images table
✅ Indexes for performance
✅ RLS disabled
✅ Permissions granted
✅ Triggers configured
✅ Legacy images migrated
```

### Storage (auto-create-storage-bucket.mjs):
```
✅ product-images bucket created
✅ Set to Public
✅ Max file size: 5MB
✅ Allowed types: JPG, PNG, WebP
```

---

## 🚨 If Script Fails

### SQL Script Error?
```bash
# Check if you have access to run SQL
# Make sure you're logged in to Neon/Supabase
```

### Node Script Error?
```bash
# Error: "Missing VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
# → Add service role key to .env file

# Error: "Permission denied"
# → Use service role key, not anon key

# Error: "Module not found"
# → Run: npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```
