# ✅ Stock Transfer UI - Complete Implementation

## 🎉 What's Been Created

A **comprehensive Stock Transfer Management System** for your multi-branch POS!

### 📦 Components Created:

1. **Stock Transfer API** (`src/lib/stockTransferApi.ts`)
   - Full CRUD operations for transfers
   - Status management (pending → approved → in transit → completed)
   - Branch-aware filtering
   - Transfer statistics

2. **Stock Transfer Management Page** (`src/features/lats/pages/StockTransferPage.tsx`)
   - Complete transfer listing with filters
   - Create transfer modal
   - Transfer details modal
   - Inline actions (approve, reject, mark in transit, complete)
   - Real-time statistics dashboard

3. **Route Configuration** (Added to `src/App.tsx`)
   - URL: `/lats/stock-transfers`
   - Admin-only access

4. **Database Functions** (`SETUP-STOCK-TRANSFER-FUNCTION.sql`)
   - Stock reduction/increase functions
   - Complete transfer transaction handler

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up Database Functions

Run the SQL script to create necessary database functions:

```bash
# Open your Neon/Supabase SQL editor and run:
SETUP-STOCK-TRANSFER-FUNCTION.sql
```

This creates:
- `reduce_variant_stock()` - Safely reduce stock from source
- `increase_variant_stock()` - Increase stock at destination
- `complete_stock_transfer_transaction()` - Handle complete transfer flow

### Step 2: Access the UI

Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5173/lats/stock-transfers
```

Or add a menu item in your navigation (recommended).

## 🔐 Permissions & Security

### Role-Based Access
- **Admin only** - Full access to stock transfers
- Future: Add manager role for branch-specific transfers

### Branch Isolation
- Users only see transfers involving their current branch
- Transfers filtered by `from_branch_id` or `to_branch_id`
- Branch context pulled from `localStorage.getItem('current_branch_id')`

### Data Validation
- Stock availability checked before transfer creation
- Quantity validation against available stock
- Branch ownership validation

---

## 💾 Database Schema

### branch_transfers Table
Already exists! Created by your branch isolation setup:

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch_transfers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  from_branch_id UUID REFERENCES store_locations(id),
  to_branch_id UUID REFERENCES store_locations(id),
  transfer_type TEXT, -- 'stock', 'customer', 'product'
  entity_type TEXT,   -- 'product', 'variant'
  entity_id UUID,     -- ID of the product/variant
  quantity INTEGER,
  status TEXT,        -- 'pending', 'approved', 'in_transit', 'completed', 'rejected', 'cancelled'
  requested_by UUID,
  approved_by UUID,
  notes TEXT,
  metadata JSONB,
  requested_at TIMESTAMP,
  approved_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Function reduce_variant_stock not found"
**Solution:** Run `SETUP-STOCK-TRANSFER-FUNCTION.sql` in your database

### "Insufficient stock" error
**Solution:** Check actual stock quantity in source branch. Transfer quantity cannot exceed available stock.

### Transfers not showing
**Solution:** 
- Verify branch is selected in branch selector
- Check status filter (set to "All Statuses")
- Verify branch has sent or received transfers

### Can't approve transfer
**Solution:** 
- Only receiving branch can approve
- Ensure you're viewing from correct branch context
- Switch branch using branch selector if needed

### Stock not updating after completion
**Solution:** 
- Verify database functions are installed
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `lats_stock_movements` table exists
