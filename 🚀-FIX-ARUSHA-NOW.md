# 🚀 FIX ARUSHA INVENTORY - DO THIS NOW!

## ⚡ Quick Fix (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Neon Database
1. Go to your Neon database console
2. Open the SQL editor

### Step 2: Run This Script
Copy and run: **`FIX-ARUSHA-INVENTORY-COMPLETE.sql`**

```sql
-- Just paste the entire contents of FIX-ARUSHA-INVENTORY-COMPLETE.sql
-- and click "Run"
```

### Step 3: Refresh Browser
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux)
- Or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)

### Step 4: Test
1. Switch to ARUSHA branch
2. Open inventory page
3. ✅ Products should now appear!

---

## 🔍 What Was Wrong?

The database function wasn't marking products as `is_shared = true` during transfers, so ARUSHA couldn't see them!

**Details:** See `🔍-ARUSHA-INVENTORY-ISSUE-SUMMARY.md`

---

## ✅ What Gets Fixed?

1. ✅ Existing products marked as shared
2. ✅ Transfer function updated to auto-share
3. ✅ ARUSHA can now see transferred products
4. ✅ All future transfers work automatically

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### Run Diagnostic First:
```sql
-- Run: DIAGNOSE-ARUSHA-INVENTORY.sql
-- This shows exactly what's wrong
```

### Check Console:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors when loading inventory
3. Share any error messages

### Verify Branch:
Make sure you're actually switched to ARUSHA branch (check the branch selector!)
