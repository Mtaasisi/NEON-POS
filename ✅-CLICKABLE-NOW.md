You now have **3 branches**:
- ✅ Main Store (Arusha) - 🌐 Shared
- ✅ ARUSHA (Dar es Salaam) - 🔒 Isolated  
- ✅ Airport Branch (Arusha) - ⚖️ Hybrid

### **2. Made Selector ALWAYS Clickable**
- Removed static display
- Added blue border (makes it obvious)
- Added hover effects (shadow + color change)
- Added console logging
