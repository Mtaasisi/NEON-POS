## 🎭 How It Works

### For Admin
```typescript
Login as admin
  ↓
Navigate to /dashboard
  ↓
Dashboard loads with role='admin'
  ↓
Shows ALL 30 widgets
```

### For Technician
```typescript
Login as technician
  ↓
Navigate to /dashboard
  ↓
Dashboard loads with role='technician'
  ↓
Shows 13 widgets (device/service focused)
  - Device Status Chart ✓
  - Service Widget ✓
  - Inventory (spare parts) ✓
  - NO financial widgets ✗
```

### For Customer Care
```typescript

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Role-Based Permissions
```typescript
// Define what each role can see
const ROLE_WIDGET_PERMISSIONS = {
  admin: { financialWidget: true, ... },
  technician: { financialWidget: false, ... },
  'customer-care': { financialWidget: false, ... }
};
```

### 2. Automatic Filtering
```typescript
// Widgets automatically show/hide
{isWidgetEnabled('financialWidget') && <FinancialWidget />}
// Checks: role allows it + user hasn't disabled it
```

### 3. Dynamic Titles
```typescript
// Dashboard title changes per role
Admin → "Admin Dashboard"
Technician → "Technician Dashboard"
Customer Care → "Customer Care Dashboard"
```

### 4. Single Codebase
- One dashboard component
- Shared widget library
- Easy to maintain
- Consistent UI

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Testing the Dashboard

1. **Login as Admin**
   ```
   Email: admin@example.com
   Password: [your password]
   ```
   Expected: See all 30 widgets

2. **Login as Technician**
   ```
   Email: tech@tech.com
   Password: 123456
   ```
   Expected: See 13 widgets (no financial)

3. **Login as Customer Care**
   ```
   Email: care@care.com
   Password: 123456
   ```
   Expected: See 16 widgets (no inventory)

### Customizing Permissions

Edit `src/config/roleBasedWidgets.ts`:
```typescript
// Example: Give technicians access to sales
const technicianWidgetPermissions = {
  ...otherPermissions,
  salesWidget: true  // Change from false
};
```

### Adding New Widgets

1. Create widget component
2. Add to `DashboardPage.tsx`
3. Define permissions in `roleBasedWidgets.ts`
4. Update interface in `useDashboardSettings.ts`

## 🎨 Architecture

### Old System (Before)
```
User Login
  ↓
Check Role
  ├─ Admin → AdminDashboard
  ├─ Technician → TechnicianDashboardPage
  └─ Customer Care → CustomerCareDashboardPage
     (3 separate components with duplicate code)
```

### New System (After)
```
User Login
  ↓
Navigate to /dashboard
  ↓
ConditionalDashboard (simple router)
  ↓
DashboardPage (unified for all)
  ↓
Role-based widget filtering
  ├─ Admin: Show all widgets
  ├─ Technician: Filter to 13 widgets
  └─ Customer Care: Filter to 16 widgets
     (Single component, automatic filtering)
```

## 🔒 Security

### UI-Level Protection
✅ Role permissions enforced in `useDashboardSettings`  
✅ Cannot be bypassed via localStorage  
✅ Type-safe permission checks

### Important Note
⚠️ **Frontend restrictions are for UX, not security**  
✅ Always validate permissions on the backend  
✅ Frontend filters what users SEE  
✅ Backend controls what users CAN DO
