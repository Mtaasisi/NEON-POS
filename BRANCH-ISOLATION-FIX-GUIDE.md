# üîß Branch Isolation Fix Guide

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Runtime Error: `branchSettings is not defined`** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The `branchSettings` variable was defined inside a conditional block but referenced outside its scope in `latsProductApi.ts`.

**Fix:** Moved the `branchSettings` declaration outside the conditional block so it's accessible throughout the entire function.

**File:** `src/lib/latsProductApi.ts`

**Result:** The inventory page will now load without crashing! üéâ

### 2. **Branch Isolation Violations** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:** Your branch is in **ISOLATED** mode but still showing data from other branches:
- 11 customers from other branches
- 66 inventory items from other branches  
- 71 products from other branches

**Cause:** The data in your database has incorrect `branch_id` assignments. This likely happened before the branch isolation system was properly implemented.

**Solution:** Use the new **Branch Data Cleanup Tool** (see below)

---

## How to Use the Branch Data Cleanup Tool

### Step 1: Access the Tool

1. Go to **Admin Settings** (Settings icon in sidebar)
2. Navigate to **Branch Debug** section
3. Scroll down to find **"üîß Branch Data Cleanup"** panel

### Step 2: Analyze Your Data

Click **"üîç Analyze Data"** button to see:
- Total records in each table
- Records belonging to current branch
- **Records from other branches** (these are violations!)
- Unassigned records (no branch_id)

### Step 3: Fix the Issues

If violations are found, click **"üîß Cleanup Data"** button.

You'll have two options:

#### Option A: Reassign to Current Branch (‚úÖ Recommended)
- Moves all data from other branches to your current branch
- **No data is lost**
- Safe and reversible

#### Option B: Delete Records (‚ö†Ô∏è Dangerous)
- Permanently deletes records from other branches
- **Cannot be undone!**
- Only use if you're absolutely sure

### Step 4: Preview Changes (Dry Run)

**IMPORTANT:** Always click **"Dry Run"** first!
- Shows what will happen without making changes
- Check the console for detailed information
- Only proceed if you're happy with the preview

### Step 5: Apply Changes

Once you're confident, click **"Apply Changes"** to fix the issues.

## Alternative: Use Console Commands

You can also run cleanup directly from the browser console:

```javascript
// Analyze current branch data
await window.analyzeBranchData()

// Preview cleanup (dry run) - reassign mode
await window.cleanupBranchData({ action: 'reassign', dryRun: true })

// Apply cleanup - reassign mode
await window.cleanupBranchData({ action: 'reassign', dryRun: false })

// Preview cleanup (dry run) - delete mode (dangerous!)
await window.cleanupBranchData({ action: 'delete', dryRun: true })
```

## What Each Isolation Mode Does

### üîí ISOLATED Mode (Current)
- Only shows data from the current branch
- Strict separation between branches
- No shared data visible

### üåê SHARED Mode
- Shows data from ALL branches
- Complete data sharing
- No isolation

### ‚öñÔ∏è HYBRID Mode
- Configurable per data type
- Can share products but isolate customers
- Most flexible option

---

## Verification

After cleanup, run the isolation test again:

1. Go to **Admin Settings ‚Üí Branch Debug**
2. Check the **Branch Isolation Debug Panel**
3. All tests should show **‚úÖ Passed**

Expected results for ISOLATED mode:
- ‚úÖ Products: 0 from other branches
- ‚úÖ Customers: 0 from other branches
- ‚úÖ Inventory: 0 from other branches

---

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before Running Cleanup:**
1. Make sure you have a database backup
2. Always do a dry run first
3. Check the console output carefully
4. Understand which action you're taking (reassign vs delete)

üí° **Tips:**
- If unsure, choose "Reassign" instead of "Delete"
- Run analysis after cleanup to verify
- Check the isolation test panel to confirm all is working

üîÑ **After Cleanup:**
- The isolation test should show all green ‚úÖ
- No more data from other branches should appear
- Your branch will be properly isolated

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing data from other branches after cleanup

**Solution:** 
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check if you're on the correct branch
3. Re-run the analysis to confirm cleanup worked
4. Check console for any error messages

### Issue: Cleanup fails with error

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for detailed error
2. Verify you have proper permissions
3. Try refreshing and running again
4. Contact support if issue persists

---

## Need Help?

If you run into issues:
1. Check the browser console (F12) for detailed logs
2. All cleanup operations are logged with emojis for easy reading
3. Look for ‚ùå error messages or ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed:** Runtime error causing inventory page to crash  
‚úÖ **Added:** Branch data cleanup tool with UI  
‚úÖ **Added:** Analysis tool to detect isolation violations  
‚úÖ **Added:** Console commands for advanced users  

Your POS system is now ready to properly enforce branch isolation! üéâ
