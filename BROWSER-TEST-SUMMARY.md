## 🔍 Understanding the Problem

### Root Cause
Your POS system uses **branch isolation** to separate products between different stores/locations. The filtering logic is in `src/lib/latsProductApi.ts` (lines 308-740).

Products are filtered by:
- `branch_id` - Which store owns the product
- `is_shared` - Whether the product is visible to all stores
- `data_isolation_mode` - Store's isolation settings (isolated/shared/hybrid)

When products are created without proper branch assignment, they get filtered out.

### What the Fix Does
The quick fix makes all products "shared" so they're visible everywhere. This is the simplest solution and works for most use cases.

## 📊 What to Expect

### Before Fix:
```
Database: 50 products
UI Display: 0 products
Problem: Branch filtering active
```

### After Fix:
```
Database: 50 products
UI Display: 50 products  ✅
Solution: All products marked as shared
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

After running the fix script, check these things:

✅ **Products List**: Should show all products
✅ **Product Names**: Should display correctly
✅ **Prices & Quantities**: Should show proper values
✅ **POS Cart**: Should be able to add products
✅ **Console Errors**: Should be none (F12 → Console tab)

## 🆘 If It Still Doesn't Work

1. **Run the diagnostic tool** (`PRODUCT-DISPLAY-DIAGNOSTIC.js`)
2. **Copy the full console output**
3. **Check for these common issues**:
   - Are you logged in as `care@care.com`?
   - Did you clear browser cache? (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Are there any red errors in console?
   - Did the page refresh after running the script?

## 📋 Available Fix Functions

If you run the diagnostic tool, you get access to these functions:

```javascript
// Assign all products to current branch
fixProductDisplay()

// Mark all products as shared (recommended)
makeProductsShared()

// Switch store to shared mode
switchToSharedMode()
```

## 🔒 Store Isolation Modes Explained

| Mode | Behavior | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Isolated** 🔒 | Each store only sees its own products | Completely separate businesses |
| **Shared** 🌐 | All stores see all products | Single business, multiple locations |
| **Hybrid** ⚖️ | Store sees own + shared products | Franchises with some shared inventory |

The quick fix switches everything to **Shared** mode for maximum compatibility.

## 💡 Prevention Tips

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Set branch_id when creating products**:
   ```typescript
   const currentBranchId = localStorage.getItem('current_branch_id');
   productData.branch_id = currentBranchId;
   ```

2. **OR mark products as shared**:
   ```typescript
   productData.is_shared = true;
   productData.sharing_mode = 'shared';
   ```

3. **OR use shared mode for all stores** (easiest):
   ```sql
   UPDATE store_locations SET data_isolation_mode = 'shared';
   ```
