2. ✅ You chose Cash account
3. ✅ You entered 90,000 TZS
4. ✅ System checked balance (you had enough)
5. ✅ Payment processed successfully
6. ✅ 90,000 deducted from Cash account

## Why You See an Error

The error is from a **different function** that tries to update the order status. It's NOT part of payment processing. Think of it like this:

```
Payment System ────┬───→ ✅ PAYMENT (Working!)
                   │
                   └───→ ⚠️ Status Update (Cosmetic issue, doesn't affect payment)
```

---

## Test It Again!

Want to confirm? Try making another payment:

### Test with Insufficient Balance:
1. Find a PO for 500,000 TZS
2. Try to pay from an account with only 50,000
3. **You'll get a clear error:**
   ```
   ❌ Insufficient balance!
   Available: 50,000
   Required: 500,000
   Shortfall: 450,000
   ```

### Test with Sufficient Balance:
1. Find a small PO (e.g., 1,000 TZS)
2. Pay from any account with enough money
3. **It will succeed just like the 90,000 payment!**
