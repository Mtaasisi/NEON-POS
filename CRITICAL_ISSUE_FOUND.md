# üö® CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED! üö®

## The Real Problem

Your app uses **TWO SEPARATE DATABASES**:

1. **Neon Database** (where we created the installments)
   - URL: `ep-damp-fire-adtxvumr-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech`
   - ‚úÖ Has `customer_installment_plans` table
   - ‚úÖ Has 6 installments
   - ‚úÖ Everything is correct here

2. **Supabase Database** (what your frontend queries)
   - URL: `jxhzveborezjhsmzsgbc.supabase.co`
   - ‚ùå Does NOT have `customer_installment_plans` table
   - ‚ùå This is why you don't see installments!

## Why This Happened

Your `.env` file has:
```
VITE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...neon.tech/neondb    ‚Üê Neon Database
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://jxhzveborezjhsmzsgbc.supabase.co  ‚Üê Supabase
```

The frontend code uses Supabase client, which queries the Supabase database, NOT the Neon database!

## Solutions

### Option 1: Connect Supabase to Neon (RECOMMENDED)

Supabase can use Neon as its underlying database. You need to:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Open your project: `jxhzveborezjhsmzsgbc`
3. Go to **Project Settings** ‚Üí **Database**
4. Check if it's connected to your Neon database
5. If not, you'll need to reconfigure or create tables in Supabase

### Option 2: Run Migrations on Supabase Database

Run the same migration on your Supabase database:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Open your project: `jxhzveborezjhsmzsgbc`
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy and paste: `migrations/create_special_orders_and_installments.sql`
5. Click **Run**

### Option 3: Use Direct Neon Connection

Modify your code to query Neon directly instead of through Supabase API.

## Immediate Action Required

**Check your Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Login to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jxhzveborezjhsmzsgbc
2. Go to **Table Editor**
3. Look for `customer_installment_plans` table
4. If it doesn't exist ‚Üí Run Option 2 above

## Quick Test

To verify which database you're using, check the Supabase dashboard:
- If you see all your other tables (employees, customers, etc.) in Supabase, then Supabase is your main database
- If those tables are also only in Neon, then you need to connect Supabase to Neon
