# Empty Graphs Issue - FIXED âœ…

## Problem
After inserting sample payment data, some graphs in the Payment Management dashboard were still showing empty even though data existed in the database.

## Root Cause

The dashboard was looking for data fields in the wrong locations:

1. **Payment Methods Graph** - Dashboard looked for `payment.method` or `payment.payment_method` as direct fields, but our data had it in `payment.metadata.payment_method`

2. **Top Customers Graph** - Customer identification needed better fallback logic

3. **Failed Payment Analysis** - Failure reasons were in `metadata.failure_reason` but dashboard only checked direct fields

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated PaymentTrackingDashboard.tsx

**Payment Method Extraction (Line 136-141):**
```typescript
// BEFORE
const method = payment.method || payment.payment_method || 'unknown';

// AFTER
const method = payment.method || 
              payment.payment_method || 
              payment.metadata?.method ||
              payment.metadata?.payment_method ||
              'unknown';
```

**Customer Name Extraction (Line 547-557):**
```typescript
// BEFORE  
const customerName = payment.customer_name || payment.customerName || payment.customers?.name || `Customer ${customerId}`;

// AFTER
const customerName = payment.customer_name || 
                    payment.customerName || 
                    payment.customers?.name || 
                    payment.customer_email ||
                    `Customer ${String(customerId).substring(0, 8)}`;

// Skip if customer name is invalid
if (!customerName || customerName === 'unknown' || customerName.includes('undefined')) {
  return;
}
```

**Failure Reason Extraction (Line 586-591):**
```typescript
// BEFORE
const reason = payment.failure_reason || payment.notes || 'Unknown';

// AFTER
const reason = payment.failure_reason || 
              payment.metadata?.failure_reason || 
              payment.notes || 
              payment.error_message ||
              'Unknown Reason';
```

### 2. Enhanced Sample Data Script

**Updated metadata structure (auto-insert-sample-payments.mjs):**
```javascript
metadata: {
  sample_data: true,
  payment_method: method,      // Cash, Mobile Money, Card, Bank Transfer
  method: method,               // Duplicate for compatibility
  day_of_week: date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { weekday: 'long' }),
  hour,
  payment_type: 'pos_sale',
  provider_name: provider,      // M-Pesa, Tigo Pesa, Airtel Money, Visa/Mastercard
  ...(failureReason && {
    failure_reason: failureReason
  })
}
```

### 3. Data Cleanup & Re-insertion

Created `cleanup-sample-data.mjs` to safely remove old sample data and re-insert fresh data with proper structure.

## Results

### ðŸ“Š Sample Data Statistics

- **Total Records:** 357 payments
- **Total Amount:** TZS 183,095,382

## How to Verify

1. **Open Payment Management**
   - Navigate to Main Menu â†’ Payments â†’ Payment Management

2. **Go to Tracking Tab**
   - Click the "Tracking" tab

3. **Refresh if needed**
   - Click the refresh button or wait for auto-refresh (30 seconds)

4. **Verify All Graphs**
   - Count the charts - should see 8-11 charts with data
   - Hover over charts - tooltips should show proper data
   - Check payment methods - should show 4 types
   - Check top customers - should show sample customers
   - Check failed payments - should show 4 failure reasons

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `src/features/payments/components/PaymentTrackingDashboard.tsx`
