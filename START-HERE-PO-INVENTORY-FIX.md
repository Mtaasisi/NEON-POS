## 🎯 What I Found

Your purchase order and inventory system is **well-designed and comprehensive**. The relationship between POs and inventory is working correctly in the code.

However, we need to verify that:
1. ✅ Database functions are installed
2. ✅ Inventory sync trigger is active
3. ✅ Your environment is configured

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Set Up Environment (2 minutes)

You need to create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Option A: Automatic script (recommended)
./QUICK-FIX-PO-INVENTORY.sh

# Option B: Manual setup
# 1. Copy template:
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env:
nano .env
# or
code .env

# 3. Add these two lines with YOUR values:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

**Where to find these credentials:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Settings (⚙️) → API
4. Copy "Project URL" and "anon public key"

---

### Step 2: Run Verification (30 seconds)

```bash
node verify-po-inventory-setup.js
```

This will check:
- Database tables ✓
- Required functions ✓
- Inventory sync ✓
- System status ✓

---

### Step 3: Fix Any Issues (if needed)

The verification script will tell you exactly what to do.

**Common Fix #1: Missing receive function**
```bash
node run-complete-receive-migration.js
```

**Common Fix #2: Inventory out of sync**
```bash
node diagnose-and-fix-inventory-sync.js
```

**Common Fix #3: Missing quality check functions**
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
# Copy and run: migrations/create_quality_check_system.sql
```

---

## ✅ That's It!

Once verification passes, your system is ready:
- ✓ Purchase orders will update inventory correctly
- ✓ Stock levels will stay accurate
- ✓ Items will be available in POS after receiving

## 🎓 Understanding the System

### Two Ways to Track Inventory:

**1. Individual Items** (`inventory_items` table)
- One record per physical unit
- For serialized products
- Detailed tracking

**2. Aggregate Count** (`lats_product_variants.quantity`)
- Total available units
- What UI displays
- Quick access

**Important:** These MUST stay in sync!
- Solution: Automatic trigger (installed in Step 2)
