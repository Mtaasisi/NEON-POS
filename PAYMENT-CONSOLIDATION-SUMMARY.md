## ✅ What Was Done

Successfully consolidated multiple payment-related pages into a single, centralized Payment Management page.

---

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Payment Management Page** ✨
**File**: `src/features/payments/pages/EnhancedPaymentManagementPage.tsx`

**Added a new "History" tab** that includes all functionality from the old PaymentHistoryPage:
- Payment history filters (Status, Provider, Date Range)
- Transaction table with detailed information
- Real-time payment tracking
- Provider icons and status badges

**Current Tabs Structure**:
1. **Overview** - Payment tracking dashboard with metrics and analytics
2. **Payment Accounts** - Manage payment accounts and settings
3. **Purchase Orders** - Purchase order payment tracking
4. **Transactions** - All payment transactions from various sources
5. **History** - Complete payment transaction history (NEW!)

### 2. **Removed Duplicate Pages** 🗑️
Deleted the following standalone pages:
- ✅ `src/features/lats/pages/PaymentTrackingPage.tsx` (756 lines)
- ✅ `src/features/lats/pages/PaymentHistoryPage.tsx` (235 lines)

### 3. **Updated Routes** 🛤️
**File**: `src/App.tsx`

**Removed routes**:
- `/lats/payments` (PaymentTrackingPage)
- `/lats/payment-history` (PaymentHistoryPage)

**Removed imports**:
```typescript
const PaymentHistoryPage = lazy(() => import('./features/lats/pages/PaymentHistoryPage'));
const PaymentTrackingPage = lazy(() => import('./features/lats/pages/PaymentTrackingPage'));
```

### 4. **Navigation Verified** ✓
- **AppLayout.tsx**: No references to removed pages (already clean)
- **BusinessManagementPage.tsx**: Already uses correct `/finance/payments` route
