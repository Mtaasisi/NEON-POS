## 🎨 What Remains

Your payment system now has a **lean, focused structure** with only the components that are actually being used:

1. **One main page** with 5 tabs
2. **Four main dashboards** (tracking, accounts, PO, transactions)
3. **One helper component** (AccountThumbnail)
4. **Core services** only
5. **No dead code** ✨

---

## 📝 Notes

- All deleted components were **never integrated** into the main payment page
- Services were only used by the deleted components
- No functionality lost - everything needed is in the 5 active tabs
- Codebase is now cleaner and easier to maintain
