## 🎓 Error Handling Features

### Individual Column Error Handling:
Each column addition is wrapped in its own error handler:

```sql
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (...) THEN
    RAISE NOTICE '🔧 DEBUG: Adding specification column...';
    ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN specification TEXT;
    RAISE NOTICE '✅ SUCCESS: Added specification column';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE '⏭️  SKIP: specification column already exists';
  END IF;
EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
  GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS error_detail = PG_EXCEPTION_DETAIL;
  RAISE WARNING '⚠️  ERROR adding specification column: % (Detail: %)', 
                SQLERRM, error_detail;
                  ^         ^
                  Error     Additional context
END;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One column fails → Others still try
- ✅ See exactly which column failed
- ✅ Get detailed error context
- ✅ Migration continues if non-fatal

---

### Step-Level Error Handling:
Each major step has its own error handler:

```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
  -- All operations for this step
  ...
  
  RAISE NOTICE '✅ STEP 1 COMPLETE: ...';
  
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS error_detail = PG_EXCEPTION_DETAIL;
    RAISE EXCEPTION '❌ FATAL ERROR in STEP 1: % (Detail: %)', 
                    SQLERRM, error_detail;
END $$;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Know exactly which step failed
- ✅ Get full error context
- ✅ Easier to debug
- ✅ Clear error location

---

### Automatic Transaction Recovery:
```sql
-- First thing in script
ROLLBACK;  ← Clears any failed previous attempts

-- Then start fresh
BEGIN;
... migrations ...
COMMIT;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No "transaction aborted" errors
- ✅ Safe to re-run after failures
- ✅ Clean slate every time

---

### Smart Table/Role Detection:
```sql
-- Before adding foreign key:
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables 
           WHERE table_name = 'lats_store_rooms') THEN
  -- Add with foreign key
  RAISE NOTICE '✅ Adding with foreign key';
ELSE
  -- Add without foreign key
  RAISE NOTICE '⚠️  Adding without foreign key - table missing';
  RAISE NOTICE '💡 TIP: Run CREATE-STORAGE-TABLES-OPTIONAL.sql later';
END IF;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Adapts to your database
- ✅ Works even if tables missing
- ✅ Tells you what's missing
- ✅ Suggests fixes

---

## 📖 Error Message Format

### Every Error Shows:

**1. Error Level:**
- ❌ FATAL ERROR = Migration stops
- ⚠️  WARNING = Continues running
- 💡 TIP = Helpful suggestion

**2. Context:**
```
⚠️  ERROR adding specification column: permission denied
              ^                         ^
              What was being attempted  What went wrong
```

**3. Details:**
```
(Detail: User does not have ALTER TABLE privilege)
         ^
         Additional technical context
```

**4. Location:**
```
❌ FATAL ERROR in STEP 1: ...
                  ^
                  Which step failed
```

---

## 🎯 Error Tracking Example

### Scenario: Column Addition Fails

**You'll See:**
```
🔧 DEBUG: Adding specification column...
⚠️  ERROR adding specification column: column "specification" already exists
    (Detail: Column already exists in the table schema)

⏭️  Continuing with next column...

🔧 DEBUG: Adding condition column...
✅ SUCCESS: Added condition column
```

**What This Tells You:**
1. Tried to add specification → Failed (already exists)
2. Got full error with details
3. Script continued automatically
4. Next column succeeded
5. Migration didn't stop for non-fatal error

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### You Can See:
- **Starting state**: "currently has 12 columns"
- **Each operation**: "Adding X column..." → "✅ SUCCESS"
- **Skipped items**: "⏭️  SKIP: already exists"
- **Final state**: "now has 20 columns"

### Count Tracking:
```
📊 DEBUG: lats_products currently has 12 columns  ← Before
... operations ...
✅ STEP 1 COMPLETE: lats_products now has 20 columns  ← After
                                            ^
                                            Added 8 columns!
```

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### 1. Transaction Safety
```sql
ROLLBACK;  -- Clear any previous failed state
BEGIN;     -- Start fresh transaction
... ops ...
COMMIT;    -- Only commit if all succeeds
```

### 2. Idempotent Operations
```sql
-- Safe to run multiple times
IF NOT EXISTS (...) THEN
  -- Only adds if missing
END IF;
```

### 3. Non-Destructive
```sql
-- Never drops or deletes data
-- Only adds or modifies
-- Existing data preserved
```

### 4. Graceful Degradation
```sql
-- If optional feature fails, continues
-- Core features still work
⚠️  WARNING: ... (continuing)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Read from Top to Bottom
Start at the first error and work down. Earlier errors might cause later ones.

### 2. Look for Context
Error appears at line 150? Scroll up to see what was being attempted:
```
🔧 DEBUG: Adding specification column...  ← Line 148
❌ ERROR: ...  ← Line 150
```

### 3. Check Step Completion
If you see:
```
✅ STEP 1 COMPLETE
✅ STEP 2 COMPLETE
⚠️  ERROR in STEP 3  ← Failed here
```
Steps 1-2 worked! Issue is in step 3.

### 4. Use Verification Script
After migration:
```sql
-- Run this to double-check everything
\i ✅ VERIFY-MIGRATION-SUCCESS.sql
```
