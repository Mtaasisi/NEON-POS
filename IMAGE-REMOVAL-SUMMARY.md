### Database Migration Created:

**File:** `REMOVE-IMAGE-UPLOAD-FEATURE.sql`

This SQL script will:
- Drop the `product_images` table completely
- Remove `images` column from `lats_products` table (if exists)
- Drop image-related triggers:
  - `update_product_images_updated_at`
  - `ensure_single_primary_image_trigger`
- Drop image-related functions:
  - `update_product_images_updated_at()`
  - `ensure_single_primary_image()`

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Run the Database Migration

Copy and run the `REMOVE-IMAGE-UPLOAD-FEATURE.sql` script in your database SQL editor:

```bash
# In your database client (Neon, Supabase, etc.)
# Copy the contents of REMOVE-IMAGE-UPLOAD-FEATURE.sql and execute
```

### 2. Manual Cleanup (If Using Supabase)

If you're using Supabase with storage buckets:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Storage**
2. Find and delete the `product-images` bucket
3. This will remove all uploaded product images from storage

### 3. Test the Changes

#### Test Product Creation:
1. Navigate to **Add Product** page
2. Fill in product details (name, SKU, category, price, etc.)
3. Verify the image upload section is **NOT visible**
4. Click **Create Product**
5. Verify product is created successfully without errors

#### Test Product Editing:
1. Navigate to **Products** list
2. Click **Edit** on an existing product
3. Verify the image upload section is **NOT visible**
4. Make some changes and save
5. Verify product updates successfully without errors

#### Test Product Variants:
1. Create a product with variants enabled
2. Add multiple variants
3. Save the product
4. Verify variants are saved correctly without image-related errors

- ❌ Image-related triggers and functions

## 💾 Files That Still Exist (But Not Used)

These files still exist in the codebase but are no longer imported/used:

- `src/features/lats/components/product/ProductImagesSection.tsx`
- `src/lib/imageCompressionService.ts`
- `src/lib/robustImageService.ts`

**Note:** These can be safely deleted if you're certain you won't need image uploads in the future.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No Linting Errors**: All changes have been validated with the linter - zero errors!
2. **Type Safety**: All TypeScript types have been updated to remove image references
3. **Data Integrity**: Products created before this change may have had images, but those references will simply be ignored
4. **Reversible**: If you need to add images back, you can:
   - Restore the component files
   - Re-run a database migration to recreate the `product_images` table
   - Revert the form changes using git
