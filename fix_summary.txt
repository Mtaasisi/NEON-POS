Changes made:
1. ✅ Added payment and expense loading to initial page load
2. ✅ Payments now load immediately when PO detail page opens
3. ✅ Expenses also load on initial page load
4. ✅ Both use proper branch isolation
5. ✅ UI displays both payments and expenses in separate sections

To test:
1. Navigate to PO detail page for PO-1763231644894
2. Check browser console for payment loading logs
3. Verify payments appear in the Payment History section
4. Check that expenses appear in the Expense History section (should be empty for this PO)

The payment data exists in the database and should now be displayed in the UI.
