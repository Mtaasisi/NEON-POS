## 🗑️ Cleanup Recommended

These 3 test files were not linked (and shouldn't be):

```bash
# Delete these test/duplicate files:
rm src/features/settings/pages/IntegrationSettingsTest.tsx
rm src/features/settings/pages/SimpleIntegrationSettings.tsx
rm src/pages/TestBrandingFetchPage.tsx
```

---

## ⚠️ Note

There's one pre-existing linter error in `StoreLocationManagementPage` (not related to these changes). It's been there before and doesn't affect the newly added pages.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Update ConditionalDashboard
Consider updating `ConditionalDashboard.tsx` to automatically route users based on role:

```tsx
// In ConditionalDashboard.tsx
if (currentUser.role === 'technician') {
  navigate('/dashboard/technician');
} else if (currentUser.role === 'customer-care') {
  navigate('/dashboard/customer-care');
} else if (currentUser.role === 'admin') {
  navigate('/dashboard/admin');
}
```

### Tip 2: Add Navigation Links
Add these pages to your AppLayout sidebar so users can access them easily.

### Tip 3: Feature Flags
If some pages aren't useful, you can comment out their routes instead of deleting them completely.
