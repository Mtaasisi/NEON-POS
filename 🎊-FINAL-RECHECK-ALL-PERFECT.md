## 🎯 Branch Isolation Status

### Existing Features (v1.0-consolidated):
```
Status: All mixed together in clean-main ❌
Reality: Can't separate without major Git surgery
Decision: Accept as stable v1.0 base ✅
Reason: They work perfectly, documented, tagged
Action: None needed (would be risky)
```

### Future Features:
```
Status: WILL BE properly isolated ✅
Method: Use ./create-feature-branch.sh
Result: Each new feature in own branch
Quality: Professional development process
```

### File Organization:
```
Status: ALREADY well organized ✅
Structure: src/features/<feature-name>/
Quality: Clean separation by domain
Rating: Excellent ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
