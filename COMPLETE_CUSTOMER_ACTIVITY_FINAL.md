| Activity | Table | Column Link | Limit | Status |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Devices** | `devices` | `customer_id` | 50 | âœ… Working |

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works**

### When you click a customer:
1. **Fetches customer info** from `customers` table
2. **Parallel queries** to ALL 6 activity tables
3. **Phone matching** for sales (handles two customer table system)
4. **Combines & sorts** all activities by date
5. **Displays** in beautiful organized tabs

### Overview Timeline:
- Combines ALL activities from all sources
- Sorts by date (newest â†’ oldest)
- Shows with icons and color coding
- Each item clickable (devices open detail page)

### Individual Tabs:
- Shows FULL list of that activity type
- No limits on overview (up to 50 items)
- Proper empty states
- Clean, organized display

## âœ¨ **User Experience**

### What You See:
1. **Stats at top** - Quick overview of all activity counts
2. **Tabs** - Easy navigation between activity types
3. **Timeline** - Unified view of everything (Overview tab)
4. **Details** - Full information for each activity
5. **Actions** - Click devices, view all buttons
6. **Profile button** - Jump to full customer page

### Color Coding:
- All devices have blue accents
- Sales have green accents
- Payments have purple accents
- Appointments have cyan accents
- Notes have amber accents
- Messages have indigo accents

## ðŸš€ **Performance**
- **Parallel queries**: All 6 data types fetched simultaneously
