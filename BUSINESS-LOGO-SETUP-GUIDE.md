# üìã Business Logo Setup Guide

This guide will help you add your business logo to receipts, invoices, and other documents in your POS system.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

First, run the SQL migration to ensure all business information fields exist in your database:

```sql
-- Run this in your Neon/Supabase SQL editor
\i add-business-logo-fields.sql
```

Or copy and paste the contents of `add-business-logo-fields.sql` directly into your database console.

### Step 2: Access Settings

1. Navigate to your POS system
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **POS Settings** ‚Üí **General Settings**
3. Look for the **Business Information** section (it should be at the top)

### Step 3: Upload Your Logo

In the Business Information section, you'll find:

- **Business Name** - Your store name (e.g., "LATS Chance Store")
- **Business Address** - Your physical address
- **Business Phone** - Contact phone number
- **Business Email** - Contact email address
- **Business Website** - Your website URL (optional)
- **Business Logo** - Upload your logo here!

#### Logo Requirements:
- **Formats**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Max Size**: 2MB
- **Recommended Size**: 200x200 pixels (square or rectangular)
- **Tip**: Use a transparent background (PNG) for best results

#### How to Upload:
1. Click the **"Upload Logo"** button
2. Select your logo file from your computer
3. Preview will appear immediately
4. Click **"Save Settings"** at the bottom to save

#### To Remove Logo:
- Click the **X** button on the top-right corner of the logo preview
- Click **"Save Settings"** to confirm removal

## üìÑ Where Your Logo Appears

Once uploaded and saved, your logo will automatically appear in:

1. **Receipts** - Printed and digital receipts
2. **Invoices** - Customer invoices
3. **Purchase Orders** - Supplier purchase orders
4. **Reports** - Various business reports

## üîß Technical Details

### How It Works

The logo is:
- **Stored as Base64** - No external file storage needed
- **Cached** - Loaded once and cached for 5 minutes for performance
- **Automatically Synced** - All receipt/invoice generations use the latest logo

### Code Integration

If you're a developer and want to use the business info in custom components:

```typescript
import { useBusinessInfo } from '../hooks/useBusinessInfo';

function MyComponent() {
  const { businessInfo, loading, error } = useBusinessInfo();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {businessInfo.logo && (
        <img src={businessInfo.logo} alt={businessInfo.name} />
      )}
      <h1>{businessInfo.name}</h1>
      <p>{businessInfo.address}</p>
      <p>{businessInfo.phone}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Or directly use the service:

```typescript
import { businessInfoService } from '../lib/businessInfoService';

async function generateDocument() {
  const info = await businessInfoService.getBusinessInfo();
  // Use info.logo, info.name, etc.
}
```

## üì± Receipt Settings

You can control whether the logo appears on receipts:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **POS Settings** ‚Üí **Receipt Settings**
2. Find **"Show Business Logo"** toggle
3. Enable/disable as needed
4. Save settings

## üé® Best Practices

### Logo Design Tips:
- Use high contrast colors for better printing
- Keep it simple - detailed logos may not print well on thermal printers
- Test print a receipt after uploading to ensure quality
- Use a square or slightly rectangular logo (1:1 or 2:1 ratio)

### File Size Optimization:
- Compress your logo before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG)
- A 100KB logo is plenty for most use cases
- Smaller files = faster loading

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Appearing?
1. **Check if you saved settings** - Upload alone doesn't save, you must click "Save Settings"
2. **Verify Receipt Settings** - Ensure "Show Business Logo" is enabled in Receipt Settings
3. **Clear browser cache** - Sometimes cached data prevents logo from updating
4. **Check file size** - Must be under 2MB
5. **Check file format** - Must be JPG, PNG, GIF, or WebP

### Logo Quality Issues?
- Upload a higher resolution image (at least 200x200px)
- Use PNG format with transparent background
- Ensure good contrast between logo and white background

### Settings Not Saving?
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. Verify database connection
3. Check if you have permission to update settings
4. Try refreshing the page and uploading again

## üÜò Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Console Logs** - Open browser console (F12) and look for errors
2. **Verify Database** - Ensure `general_settings` table has all required columns
3. **Re-run Migration** - Try running `add-business-logo-fields.sql` again
4. **Clear Cache** - The business info service caches for 5 minutes

## ‚ú® Features Added

This implementation includes:

- ‚úÖ Logo upload with drag & drop support
- ‚úÖ Instant preview before saving
- ‚úÖ Base64 encoding for easy storage
- ‚úÖ Automatic caching for performance
- ‚úÖ Integration with receipts, invoices, and reports
- ‚úÖ Full business information management
- ‚úÖ Easy to extend for custom use cases

## üìù Notes

- **Privacy**: Logo is stored in your database, not on external servers
- **Performance**: Logo is cached to minimize database queries
- **Compatibility**: Works with all browsers and devices
- **Scalability**: Base64 storage works for most use cases, but for very large deployments, consider using file storage services
