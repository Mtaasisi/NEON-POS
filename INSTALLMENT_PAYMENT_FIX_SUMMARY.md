# Installment Payment Modal Fix - Summary

## Date
October 22, 2025

## Issue Reported
User requested automatic browser testing of the installment payment feature. Upon testing, the payment modal was not visible when clicking the "Pay" button on the installments page.

## Investigation Process

### 1. Initial Test
- Created automated browser test using Playwright
- Successfully logged in as care@care.com
- Navigated to installments page
- Found 6 active installment plans with "Pay" buttons
- **Issue Found**: Clicking "Pay" button did not show a visible modal

### 2. Detailed Analysis
- Modal **was** being created in the DOM
- Modal contained all correct content ("Record Payment", form fields, etc.)
- Modal had `display: flex` and proper structure
- **Root Cause**: Modal had `z-index: 50` which was the same z-index as 29 visible navigation tooltips

### 3. Z-Index Conflict
The modal was being rendered **behind** or **at the same layer** as navigation tooltips because:
- Payment modal: `z-50`
- Navigation tooltips: `z-50` (29 visible tooltips)
- Other critical modals in the app use: `z-[9999]` or `z-[100000]`

## Solution

Updated all modals in `/src/features/installments/pages/InstallmentsPage.tsx` to use `z-[9999]` instead of `z-50`.

### Changed Lines
```tsx
// Before
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center z-50 p-4">

// After
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center z-[9999] p-4">
```

### Modals Updated
1. RecordInstallmentPaymentModal (line 1004)
2. CreateInstallmentPlanModal (line 667)
3. ViewScheduleModal (line 1185)
4. ViewPlanDetailsModal (line 1445)
5. EditInstallmentPlanModal (line 2018)
6. ViewPaymentHistoryModal (line 2165)

## Recommendation
Consider auditing other modals in the application to ensure they use appropriate z-index values (`z-[9999]` or higher) to avoid similar visibility issues.

## Status
✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

The installment payment modal is now fully functional and visible to users.
