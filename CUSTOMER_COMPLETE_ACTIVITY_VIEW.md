## ðŸ”„ **How It Works**

### Data Flow:
1. **Search Customer** â†’ Global Search finds customer in `customers` table
2. **Click Customer** â†’ Modal opens with customer ID
3. **Fetch All Data** â†’ Parallel queries to all tables:
   - `devices` by customer_id
   - `customer_payments` by customer_id  
   - `lats_sales` by phone matching (links two customer tables)
   - `appointments` by customer_id
   - `customer_notes` by customer_id
   - `customer_messages` by customer_id
4. **Display** â†’ Shows in organized tabs with counts

### The Two Customer Tables Problem (SOLVED! âœ…)
Your database has:
- `customers` (legacy repair shop) - used by devices, payments, appointments
- `lats_customers` (new LATS/POS) - used by sales

**Solution**: Match by phone number!
```typescript
// Get customer phone from 'customers' table
const { data: customerData } = await supabase
  .from('customers')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', customerId)
  .single();

// Find sales by matching phone in 'lats_customers'
const { data: salesData } = await supabase
  .from('lats_sales')
  .select(`*, lats_customers!inner (phone)`)
  .eq('lats_customers.phone', customerData.phone);
```

- Customer full info card (name, phone, email, city, loyalty level, points)
