- **All 15 products** now have proper variants

### 2. ✅ Fixed Application Code
- **Updated `variantUtils.ts`** to remove unused fields (`weight`, `dimensions`, `barcode`)
- Code now only sends fields your database actually uses

### 3. ✅ Restarted Dev Server

- **Started fresh server** with all fixes applied
- **Server is running** on `http://localhost:3000`
