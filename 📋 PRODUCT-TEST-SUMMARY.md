## 🌟 Why Screenshots Matter

**Without screenshots:**
- "The test failed at step 3"
- "There's an error somewhere"
- "I think the form didn't submit"

**With screenshots:**
- 📸 See exactly what the form looked like
- 📸 See the exact error message
- 📸 See what happened before and after
- 📸 Visual proof of what went wrong
