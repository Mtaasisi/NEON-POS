# ✅ Account Balance UI Refresh - FIXED!

**Issue:** Balance not updating in UI after payment  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date:** October 13, 2025

---

## 🔍 What Was Happening

You made a payment of **TZS 90,000** and it was successful in the database, but the UI was still showing the old balance.

### Database Status (CORRECT):
```
Cash Account Balance: TZS 60,524.50
Recent Payments from Cash:
  - TZS 90,000 at 7:35 PM (Your payment) ✅
  - TZS 260,000 at 7:18 PM (Earlier payment) ✅

Total deducted: 350,000 TZS
Balance correctly updated in database! ✅
```

### UI Status (WAS INCORRECT):
```
❌ UI showing old balance (not refreshed)
❌ Payment modal not reloading account data
❌ User sees stale information
```

---

## ✅ The Fix

Added automatic page reload after successful payment:

```typescript
// After payment succeeds:
toast.success('All payments processed successfully');
setShowPurchaseOrderPaymentModal(false);

// Reload purchase order data
await loadPurchaseOrder();

// Force reload the entire page to refresh all account balances
// This ensures the UI shows updated balances immediately
setTimeout(() => {
  window.location.reload();
}, 500);
```

### Why This Works:
1. ✅ Payment processes successfully
2. ✅ Success message shows
3. ✅ Modal closes
4. ✅ Page reloads automatically (after 0.5 seconds)
5. ✅ Fresh data loaded from database
6. ✅ **You see the updated balance!**
