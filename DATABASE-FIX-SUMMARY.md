# Database Fix Summary - Sales Error Resolution

## Problem
The POS system was failing to create sales with the error:
```
column "sold_by" of relation "lats_sales" does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The `lats_sales` table was missing several columns that the application code expected:
- `sold_by` (TEXT) - to track which user made the sale
- `customer_email` (TEXT) - customer email address  
- `customer_name` (TEXT) - customer full name
- `customer_phone` (TEXT) - customer phone number
- `discount` (NUMERIC) - discount amount
- `payment_method` needed to be JSONB (was TEXT) - to store payment details as JSON

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Columns ✅
```sql
ALTER TABLE lats_sales ADD COLUMN sold_by TEXT;
ALTER TABLE lats_sales ADD COLUMN customer_email TEXT;
ALTER TABLE lats_sales ADD COLUMN customer_name TEXT;
ALTER TABLE lats_sales ADD COLUMN customer_phone TEXT;
ALTER TABLE lats_sales ADD COLUMN discount NUMERIC DEFAULT 0;
```

### 2. Converted payment_method to JSONB ✅
```sql
ALTER TABLE lats_sales ALTER COLUMN payment_method DROP DEFAULT;
ALTER TABLE lats_sales ALTER COLUMN payment_method TYPE JSONB 
USING CASE 
  WHEN payment_method IS NULL OR payment_method = '' 
  THEN '{"type":"cash","amount":0,"details":{}}'::jsonb
  WHEN payment_method ~ '^[\\s]*[\\{\\[]'
  THEN payment_method::jsonb
  ELSE jsonb_build_object('type', payment_method, 'amount', 0, 'details', '{}')
END;
```

## Current lats_sales Schema

The table now has all required columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | uuid | Primary key |
| sale_number | text | Unique sale number |
| customer_id | uuid | Reference to customers table |
| user_id | uuid | User who created the sale |
| total_amount | numeric | Total sale amount |
| discount_amount | numeric | Discount amount (legacy) |
| tax_amount | numeric | Tax amount (legacy) |
| final_amount | numeric | Final amount after discounts |
| **payment_method** | **jsonb** | Payment method details (JSON) ✅ |
| payment_status | text | Payment status |
| status | text | Sale status |
| notes | text | Additional notes |
| created_at | timestamp | Created timestamp |
| updated_at | timestamp | Updated timestamp |
| subtotal | numeric | Subtotal before tax/discount |
| tax | numeric | Tax amount |
| **sold_by** | **text** | User email who made the sale ✅ |
| **customer_email** | **text** | Customer email ✅ |
| **customer_name** | **text** | Customer name ✅ |
| **customer_phone** | **text** | Customer phone ✅ |
| **discount** | **numeric** | Discount amount ✅ |

## Files Created

1. **FIX-SOLD-BY-COLUMN.sql** - Manual SQL script
2. **apply-sold-by-fix.mjs** - Automated fix for sold_by and customer_email
3. **add-remaining-columns.mjs** - Added customer_name, customer_phone, discount
4. **convert-payment-method-to-jsonb.mjs** - Converted payment_method to JSONB

## Result

✅ **All fixes applied successfully!**

The POS system should now be able to:
- Create sales without schema errors
- Store complete customer information
- Track who made each sale
- Handle JSON payment methods properly
- Apply discounts correctly

## Testing

Try processing a sale now. The error should be resolved and sales should be created successfully.

## Cleanup

You can delete these temporary fix scripts once you've verified everything works:
- apply-sold-by-fix.mjs
- add-remaining-columns.mjs  
- convert-payment-method-to-jsonb.mjs

Keep `FIX-SOLD-BY-COLUMN.sql` for reference.
