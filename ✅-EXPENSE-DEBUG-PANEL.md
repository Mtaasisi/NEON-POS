## 🔍 What Gets Logged

### **Component Lifecycle**
```
[LIFECYCLE] Component mounted, initializing data fetch
```

### **API Operations**
```
[FETCH_EXPENSES] Starting to fetch expenses...
[FETCH_EXPENSES] Fetched 25 expense transactions
[FETCH_EXPENSES] Successfully mapped accounts to expenses
[FETCH_EXPENSES] Fetch completed successfully (125.43ms)
```

### **Data Filtering**
```
[FILTER] Filtering expenses
[FILTER] Filtered to 15 expenses
[STATS] Calculated summary statistics
```

### **Form Interactions**
```
[FORM] Field "account_id" changed
[FORM] Field "amount" changed
[ADD_EXPENSE] Starting expense creation...
[ADD_EXPENSE] Validation passed
[ADD_EXPENSE] Expense created successfully! (234.56ms)
```

### **Validation Issues**
```
[ADD_EXPENSE] Validation failed: Missing required fields
[ADD_EXPENSE] Validation failed: Invalid amount
```

### **Errors**
```
[FETCH_EXPENSES] Supabase query failed
[ADD_EXPENSE] Database insert failed
```

---

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

Every API call and operation shows execution time:

```
✅ [FETCH_EXPENSES] Fetch completed successfully (125.43ms)
✅ [ADD_EXPENSE] Expense created successfully (234.56ms)
✅ [FETCH_CATEGORIES] Fetched 10 active categories (45.21ms)
```

This helps identify:
- Slow operations
- Database query performance
- Network latency issues
- Optimization opportunities

---

## 🛠️ Console Integration

All debug logs are **also logged to browser console** with color coding!

Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab to see:

```javascript
🔵 [FETCH_EXPENSES] Starting to fetch expenses... {...}
🟢 [FETCH_EXPENSES] Fetch completed successfully {...}
🔵 [FILTER] Filtering expenses {...}
🟣 [ADD_EXPENSE] Starting expense creation... {...}
```
