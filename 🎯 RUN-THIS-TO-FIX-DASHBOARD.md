# ðŸŽ¯ Fix Purchase Order Dashboard 400 Errors

## What's Wrong?

Your Purchase Order Payment Dashboard is getting 400 errors because:
1. Missing columns in `lats_purchase_orders` table (`order_number`, `currency`, `total_paid`, `payment_status`, `expected_delivery`)
2. Table structure mismatch between what the dashboard expects and what exists in the database
3. Missing or incorrect RLS policies

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Neon SQL Editor
1. Go to your Neon Console: https://console.neon.tech
2. Select your project
3. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Fix
1. Open the file: `FIX-PURCHASE-ORDER-DASHBOARD-ERRORS.sql`
2. Copy ALL the contents
3. Paste into Neon SQL Editor
4. Click "Run" button

### Step 3: Verify
You should see output like:
```
âœ… Added order_number column
âœ… Added currency column
âœ… Added total_paid column
âœ… Added payment_status column
âœ… Added expected_delivery column
âœ… ALL FIXES APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY!
```

### Step 4: Refresh Your App
1. Go back to your app
2. Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
3. The 400 errors should be gone!

## What This Fix Does

1. âœ… Adds missing columns to `lats_purchase_orders`
2. âœ… Creates proper `purchase_order_payments` table
3. âœ… Sets up automatic triggers to update payment status
4. âœ… Fixes RLS policies for authenticated users
5. âœ… Syncs data between old and new columns

## If You Still Get Errors

Check the browser console and look for the specific error message. Common issues:
- **Still seeing 400 errors**: Make sure the SQL ran completely without errors
- **Authentication errors**: Check that you're logged in
- **Empty data**: This is normal if you haven't created any purchase orders yet

## Test It

After running the fix:
1. Go to Purchase Orders section in your app
2. The dashboard should load without 400 errors
3. You should see purchase order cards (or empty state if no orders exist)
4. Payment functionality should work
