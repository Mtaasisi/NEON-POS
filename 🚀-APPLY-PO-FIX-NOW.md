## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Run During Low Traffic**: Although the script is safe, run it when fewer users are active

2. **Backup First** (Optional): Neon provides automatic backups, but you can create a snapshot:
   ```sql
   -- Optional: Create backup of relevant tables
   CREATE TABLE finance_expenses_backup AS SELECT * FROM finance_expenses;
   CREATE TABLE account_transactions_backup AS SELECT * FROM account_transactions;
   ```

3. **Check Before & After**:
   ```sql
   -- Before running fix
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM finance_expenses WHERE category = 'Purchase Orders';
   
   -- After running fix - should be higher
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM finance_expenses WHERE category = 'Purchase Orders';
   ```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Error: "permission denied for table"
**Solution**: Make sure you're connected as a user with CREATE/ALTER privileges

### Error: "relation does not exist"
**Solution**: Check that tables `finance_expenses`, `purchase_order_payments`, and `lats_purchase_orders` exist

### No expenses created
**Solution**: 
1. Check if you have any completed PO payments:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM purchase_order_payments WHERE status = 'completed';
   ```
2. Check trigger is active:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
   WHERE trigger_name = 'trigger_track_po_payment_spending';
   ```

### Fix runs but no change in spending
**Solution**: 
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check the expense category filter in your spending report
