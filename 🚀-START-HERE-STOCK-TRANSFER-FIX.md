## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Database Functions**
   - ✅ `complete_stock_transfer_transaction` - Main receive function
   - ✅ `find_or_create_variant_at_branch` - Auto-creates products at destination
   - ✅ `reserve_variant_stock` - Reserves stock for transfers
   - ✅ `release_variant_stock` - Releases reservations
   - ✅ `reduce_variant_stock` - Reduces stock at source
   - ✅ `increase_variant_stock` - Increases stock at destination

2. **Arusha Branch**
   - ✅ Created if missing
   - ✅ Configured properly
   - ✅ Ready to receive transfers

3. **Workflow Issues**
   - ✅ Stock reservation handling
   - ✅ Atomic transactions (no partial updates)
   - ✅ Variant auto-creation at destination
   - ✅ Proper error messages
