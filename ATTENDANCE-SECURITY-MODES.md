## Tips & Best Practices

### üéØ For Most Businesses
Use **Auto-Location** - it's the sweet spot between security and convenience.

### üè¢ For Multiple Offices
Use **Auto-Location** or **Manual Location** depending on how close your offices are.

### üì∂ For Single Office
Consider **WiFi Only** if you have strong WiFi coverage throughout the office.

### üîí For High Security
Use **Location + WiFi** or **Maximum Security** depending on your requirements.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Photo Only
Unless you have a specific use case (remote work, field staff), photo-only is not secure enough.

## Database Changes

The new `securityMode` field is automatically added to your attendance settings:
- Stored in the `settings` table
- Key: `attendance`
- Value includes: `securityMode` field

**No manual database migration needed!**

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `src/lib/attendanceSettingsApi.ts` - Added SecurityMode type
- ‚úÖ `src/features/admin/pages/AdminSettingsPage.tsx` - Added security mode selector UI
- ‚úÖ `src/features/employees/components/SecureAttendanceVerification.tsx` - Updated to respect security mode

## Need Help?

If you need to customize the security modes further or add new verification methods, the main logic is in:
- `SecureAttendanceVerification.tsx` - Controls which steps are shown
- `attendanceSettingsApi.ts` - Defines available security modes
- `AdminSettingsPage.tsx` - Admin configuration UI
