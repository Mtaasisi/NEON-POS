# ✅ ADD: Branch Label to Customer UI

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Feature:** Display branch name for each customer in the UI  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 What Was Added

Added branch label display to the customer list so users can see which branch each customer belongs to.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Customer Type** (`src/types.ts`)

Added branch fields to the Customer interface:

```typescript
// Branch tracking (customers are shared, but we track which branch created them)
branchId?: string; // Current branch assignment (for branch isolation)
branchName?: string; // Current branch name for display
createdByBranchId?: string; // Branch that originally created this customer
createdByBranchName?: string; // Branch name for display
```

### 2. **Updated Customer API** (`src/lib/customerApi/core.ts`)

Modified customer queries to fetch branch name via JOIN:

```typescript
// Before
.select('id,name,phone,email,...,branch_id,is_shared')

// After
.select('id,name,phone,email,...,branch_id,is_shared,store_locations(name)')
```

This creates a JOIN with the `store_locations` table to fetch the branch name.

### 3. **Updated Customer List UI** (`src/features/customers/pages/CustomersPage.tsx`)

#### A. Added Branch Column to Table View

**Table Header:**
```tsx
<th className="text-left py-4 px-4 font-medium text-gray-700">Branch</th>
```

**Table Cell:**
```tsx
<td className="py-4 px-4">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-full"></div>
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 font-medium">
      {(customer as any).store_locations?.name || customer.createdByBranchName || 'Unknown'}
    </span>
  </div>
</td>
```

#### B. Added Branch Label to Grid View

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-1 text-xs text-gray-600 mb-1">
  <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-full"></div>
  <span>
    {(customer as any).store_locations?.name || customer.createdByBranchName || 'Unknown Branch'}
  </span>
</div>
```

## 🎨 UI Features

### Branch Label Display
- **Blue dot indicator** (🔵) next to branch name
- **Fallback logic**: Shows `createdByBranchName` if join fails, or "Unknown Branch" if no data
- **Responsive design**: Works in both list and grid views

### Column Order (List View)
1. ☑️ Checkbox
2. 👤 Customer
3. 📞 Contact
4. **🏪 Branch** ← NEW
5. 📱 Devices
6. 💰 Total Spent
7. ⭐ Loyalty
8. 🎯 Points
9. 🏷️ Status
10. ⚙️ Actions

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### Database Query
```sql
SELECT 
  customers.*,
  store_locations.name
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN store_locations ON customers.branch_id = store_locations.id
WHERE customers.branch_id = '24cd45b8-1ce1-486a-b055-29d169c3a8ea'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Data Flow
1. **Customer API** fetches customers with `store_locations(name)` relationship
2. **Supabase** performs LEFT JOIN automatically
3. **UI** displays `customer.store_locations.name`
4. **Fallback** uses `createdByBranchName` or "Unknown Branch"

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cases

✅ **List View - Branch Column**
- Navigate to Customers page
- Switch to List View
- Verify "Branch" column appears between "Contact" and "Devices"
- Check that each customer shows their branch name with blue dot

✅ **Grid View - Branch Label**
- Switch to Grid View
- Verify branch label appears below city name
- Confirm blue dot indicator is visible

✅ **Branch Names Display Correctly**
- All customers should show "Main Store" (or their assigned branch)
- No "Unknown Branch" should appear (all customers have branch_id now)

✅ **Different Branches**
- Switch to different branch in branch selector
- Verify only customers from that branch appear
- Each customer should show the current branch name

---

## 📊 Branch Display Logic

```typescript
// Priority order for displaying branch name:
1. customer.store_locations?.name        // From JOIN (preferred)
2. customer.createdByBranchName          // Fallback from metadata
3. "Unknown Branch"                      // Last resort
```

---

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **Visibility**: Users can instantly see which branch a customer belongs to  
✅ **Clarity**: Blue dot makes branch stand out visually  
✅ **Consistency**: Shows in both list and grid views  
✅ **Reliability**: Multiple fallback options ensure something always displays
