**Solution Implemented:**

// Before ANY payment is processed:
💰 Balance check: Available=60524.50, Required=10000
✅ Sufficient balance confirmed

// If insufficient:
❌ Insufficient balance in Cash!
Available: TZS 60,524.50
Required: TZS 450,000
Shortfall: TZS 389,475.50
Please add funds to the account or use a different payment method.

### 2. ✅ Automatic Balance Deduction

```typescript
// During payment:
💳 Deducting payment: 60524.50 - 10000 = 50524.50

```

**Result:**
- ✅ Balance automatically deducted
