### Account Balances

| Account | Balance | Currency |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Cash | -TZS 503,825.14 | TZS |
| CRDB Bank | TZS 1,401,086 | TZS |

### ⚠️ Notice

The **Cash account has a negative balance** (TZS -503,825.14). This might indicate:
- Purchase order payments are deducting from cash
- Sales are adding to cash
- The negative balance suggests more outgoing than incoming
- This is an accounting concern but doesn't affect the payment recording functionality
