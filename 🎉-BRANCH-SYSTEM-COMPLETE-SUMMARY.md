## 🗄️ **DATABASE STATUS**

From verification (`VERIFY-BRANCH-SYSTEM.sql`):

```
✅ Branches: 3 configured
   - Main Store (Arusha) - 🌐 Shared
   - ARUSHA (Dar es Salaam) - 🔒 Isolated
   - Airport Branch (Arusha) - ⚖️ Hybrid

✅ Products: 69 in database (all shared)
✅ Customers: 9 in database (all shared)
✅ Sales: 20 recorded (need branch tagging)
✅ Transfers: 0 (ready to use)

✅ Helper Functions: 3/3 exist
✅ Views: 2/2 exist
✅ Tables: 7/7 exist
```

---

## 🎯 **3 DATA ISOLATION MODES**

### **🌐 Shared (Main Store)**
```
Configuration:
✓ share_products: true
✓ share_customers: true
✗ share_inventory: false

What This Means:
- Products: Visible to all branches
- Customers: Visible to all branches
- Inventory: Each branch tracks own stock
- Sales: Branch-specific
```

### **🔒 Isolated (ARUSHA)**
```
Configuration:
✗ ALL sharing disabled

What This Means:
- Products: Only ARUSHA products
- Customers: Only ARUSHA customers
- Inventory: Only ARUSHA stock
- Sales: Only ARUSHA sales
- Complete independence
```

### **⚖️ Hybrid (Airport Branch)**
```
Configuration:
✓ share_products: true
✓ share_customers: true
✗ share_inventory: false

What This Means:
- Products: Shared catalog
- Customers: Shared database
- Inventory: Separate stock per branch
- Best of both worlds
```

3. See branch selector? → ✅ PASS

### **Test 2: Click Test** ⏱️ 30 seconds
1. Click branch selector
2. Dropdown opens? → ✅ PASS
3. Shows 3 branches? → ✅ PASS

### **Test 3: Switch Test** ⏱️ 1 minute
1. Click "Airport Branch"
2. Toast appears? → ✅ PASS
3. Selector updates? → ✅ PASS
4. Console logs switch? → ✅ PASS

### **Test 4: Persistence Test** ⏱️ 30 seconds
1. Refresh browser
2. Still shows Airport Branch? → ✅ PASS

### **Test 5: Add Branch Test** ⏱️ 2 minutes
1. Settings → Store Management

## 🔧 **KNOWN ISSUES & FIXES**

### **Issue 1: Existing Sales Have No Branch**
```
Status: ⚠️ EXPECTED
Reason: Existing sales were created before branch system

Fix (Optional):
UPDATE lats_sales 
SET branch_id = (SELECT id FROM store_locations WHERE is_main = true)
WHERE branch_id IS NULL;
```

### **Issue 2: Products Not Auto-Filtering**
```
Status: ⚠️ INTEGRATION NEEDED
Reason: Product queries don't use branchAwareApi yet

Fix: Will integrate in next phase
```

### **Issue 3: Form Auto-Save**
```
Status: ✅ FIXED
Solution: Added auto-save draft feature
Result: Form doesn't clear anymore
```
